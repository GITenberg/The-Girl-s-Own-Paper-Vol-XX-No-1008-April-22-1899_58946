<p><span class="uppercase">he</span> work intended
by
that spirited
advance was
done. Nothing
remained for
Moore but to
fall steadily
back before
overwhelming odds.</p>

<p>All the bright expectations,
with which he had
started on this expedition,
were dashed to the
ground. In every direction
he had met with indifference, vacillation—even
opposition—where he ought
to have found only warm co-operation.
The Spanish forces had proved themselves
worthless. Moore’s little Army
stood alone in the heart of what was
now practically an enemy’s country.</p>

<p>With almost superhuman energy the
greatest General of his age had exerted
himself to bring up such a force, that
the complete annihilation of the British
might be a thing assured. In the course
of ten days, and in the bitterest wintry
weather, he had marched fifty thousand
soldiers over snow-clad mountains a
distance of two hundred miles, only to
find his stupendous efforts unavailing.
For the first time in Napoleon’s career,
he was decisively foiled.</p>

<p>Yet the utmost that Moore could
hope to do was to save his little Army
from destruction. To that aim he
buckled his powers with unfaltering
resolution. As Sir William Napier
wrote in after years: “The inspiring
hopes of triumph disappeared, but the
austerer glory of suffering remained;
and with a firm heart he accepted that
gift.”</p>

<p>By the greater number of Moore’s
troops this long ten days’ retreat to the
coast had to be done on foot. There
were steep mountains to be climbed;
there were deep valleys to be passed;
there were rapid rivers to be crossed;
while a confident Army, far outnumbering
them, and accustomed to unvarying
success—an Army which twice had
failed by only twelve hours to cut them
off from all hope of escape—pressed
with ever-growing fierceness upon their
rear.</p>

<p>It was mid-winter, and snow lay upon
the ground. The days were short; the
nights were bitter. Heavy ice-cold rain
fell often, adding to their difficulties.
Shelter was hard to find; provisions were
scarce; time for cooking there was not.
The Spanish Army, contrary to Moore’s
earnest request, blundered into the way
of the retreating force, eating up the
food on which it depended, and blocking
the roads with carts and mules.</p>

<p>That race between the English and
the French, first for Benevente, next for
Astorga, made it imperative that not an
hour should be lost. At all costs the men
had to press onward, putting forth their
best speed. Hour after hour, oftentimes
by night, the march continued—through
rain or snow or fog; up steep and
slippery ascents, or down sharp depths
where foothold could hardly be found;
on and on, hungry, thirsty, weary,
half asleep, not a few shoeless and
lame, many a one dropping through
weakness by the roadside, never to rise
again.</p>

<p>In the van and centre of the Army
some confusion reigned; but in the
reserve, where Moore was always to be
found, generally riding beside his friend
General Paget, discipline remained perfect,
and an impregnable front was
offered to the pursuing foe. All there
knew themselves to be under the eyes
of their Commander; and his presence,
even more than the close presence of the
enemy, kept them up to the mark. Again
and again the French advanced guards
were charged and driven back.</p>

<p>Roy Baron had passed through some
strange experiences in his short life.
He would not easily forget this last
experience—this steady disheartening
rearwards tramp, with the trained
battalions of Napoleon ever “thundering”
behind them. He would not
forget the bitter snowy weather, the
sleet and hail, the fogs and winds, the
mountain heights, the exposed nights,
the dogged pluck and determination
shown by the rear-guard, the ceaseless
care and watchfulness of Moore, the
invincible resolution of this man who,
by sheer force of will, held the whole
Army together, and never at the worst
allowed the retreat for one moment to
become a flight.</p>

<p>Not that Roy was disheartened or
depressed. Far from it. He was young
and strong and full of vigour; and the
very hardships of the march seemed
to him less hard to bear than those
of a certain march which he could
recall—from Verdun to Bitche. For
then he had been alone; he had felt
himself to be treated with cruel injustice
and tyranny. Now he was fighting for
his country; he was in the midst of
friends; and not a day passed without
a sight of the Commander, upon whom
he looked with a passionate admiration
and affection.</p>

<p>He hated the fact of having to retire,
but his trust in the judgment of Moore
was complete; and at any time it took
a great deal to lower Roy’s buoyant
spirits. Moreover, the reserve had too
much of actual hard fighting on hand,
to admit of their growing downhearted.
Any one of them might chance any day
to win a smile of commendation from
Moore; and <i>that</i> was worth fighting for,
worth bearing anything for.</p>

<p>Roy soon learnt what it was to be
under fire. If at first the experience
was to him, as to most men, unpleasant,
he grew quickly used to it. Before long
he had the supreme delight of being
personally praised by the General for
dashing courage. It seemed to Roy
then that life needed nothing more.</p>

<p>Journalising went to the wall during
this retreat. Roy made some efforts to
keep it up, but soon gave in. By the
time that the day’s duties were done, he
was commonly fit only for sleep.</p>

<p>He managed, however, to start a
letter to Molly, in readiness for the first
chance of getting it off. A thought
had come to him one day that if—if
something should happen, which might
happen to him as to any other man, it
would be wished that he should have
written once more to his twin-sister.
Whereupon he set to work so soon as
ten spare minutes could be found.</p>

<p class="p2 right">
“Dec. 30th, 1808.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Molly</span>,—Jack thinks I
may be able soon to send a letter on,
with Despatches from Headquarters,
and I w<sup>d</sup> fain have one ready. Close
upon the end of the year—truly an
eventful year to me. Jack and I
keep well, I am glad to say. There is
much that I c<sup>d</sup> tell you, but have
not time. An event which took place
yesterday, will, however, be of interest.</p>

<p>“We of the Reserve marched at
daybreak for La Banessa, and Lord
Paget as usual was to bring up the
rear. At nine o’clock the Enemy was
seen to be examining a ford near to the
bridge which had been blown up, and
next thing six hundred of Napoleon’s
Imperial Guard came over. By-the-by,
at the time of the blowing up of the
bridge, Napoleon himself was seen by
one of our officers standing over on the
other side.</p>

<p>“Only a small body of the British
piquet was there to oppose ’em, and
they held on gallantly, but were forced
back inch by inch, fighting hard. The
English and French squadrons charged
one another by turns; and when our
men were joined by a few of the 3rd
Dragoons, they all went at the Enemy
with such Desperate Valour as to break
through their front squadron, and to be
surrounded by the French. Nothing
daunted, they charged back, and broke
through again, and so got ’emselves
quick out of that scrape.</p>

<p>“Then they rallied and formed up
anew, and made another charge,
supported by the 10th Hussars. The
French broke before ever they c<sup>d</sup>
get up with ’em, and fled through the
river, hard pressed by our brave fellows.
A lot of prisoners were taken, and
among ’em is Marshal Lefebre Desnouettes,
Duke of Dantzic—I say,
doesn’t Boney love dukes?—Commander
of the Imperial Guard. Pretty big haul
that!</p>

<p>“No question but the French fought
with great valour, as was to be expected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">{467}</a></span>
General Lefebre says this same Guard
at Austerlitz sent thirty thousand
Russians flying. They didn’t send
our Dragoons flying yesterday, though.
’Twas just about the other way.</p>

<p>“And now for what you and Polly
will like best to hear. Lefebre was
awfully down in the mouth at being
taken prisoner, and his men being
beaten. He counts himself a ruined
man, for, says he, ‘Buonaparte never
forgives the unfortunate.’ Sir John
was all kindness to the poor chap.
Lefebre had a slight wound in the
head, and the first thing that Sir
John did was, not only to try to comfort
him, but to send for water, and
<i>with his own hands</i> to wash the wound!
Can’t you picture the way it was done?
Wasn’t it like Moore?</p>

<p>“Well, and it so happened that Jack
was in luck, having been asked to dine
at the General’s. So he came in for
a scene, which, I should conjecture,
has perhaps been scarce matched since
the days of the Black Prince. Just
before they all took their seats, Sir
John turned to the French General,
and asked him—was there anything
he wanted? And Lefebre said never
a word, but looked down to where his
sword ought to have been, that was
taken away by the private who made him
surrender. Then he looked up at Sir
John in a meaning way.</p>

<p>“In a moment Sir John unbuckled
his own sword—’twas a fine Eastern
scimitar—and gave it to Lefebre. I
wish you could have heard Jack and
Captain Napier tell it all—the graceful
way in which the thing was done, and,
beyond everything, the wonderful look
of kindness and ‘soldier-like sympathy’
on Sir John’s face. Napier tried to
describe it to me, and finished off with,
‘It was—perfectly beautiful! But when
does Moore ever do anything that is not
perfect!’<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>“Take good care, mind you, that no
word of this goes beyond yourselves,
and above all, on no account risk that
it sh<sup>d</sup> find its way into print. For
yourselves, ’tis a tale worth remembering
of one who is the very Flower
of Chivalry in Modern Days. This
George Napier is, as Polly knows,
Jack’s friend, brother to Major Charles
Napier of the 50th, and to William
Napier of the 43rd—a brave trio.”</p>


<p class="p2">The letter begun thus waited unfinished
for some days. Roy’s time
was occupied otherwise than in penmanship.</p>

<p>Advices by this date received from
the coast decided Moore to shape his
course, with the bulk of his Army, for
Coruña, where he expected to find the
British transports waiting.</p>

<p>At Nogales, on the road to Constantino,
occurred the one instance of treasure
to any large extent having to be
abandoned. A sharp action took place
between the English rear-guard and the
French advance-guard; and the rear-guard
coming on found upon the hillside
two guns broken down, and two carts
heavily laden with casks full of dollars,
to the value, it was afterwards said, of
twenty-five thousand pounds. The bullocks
by which both the carts and the
guns had been drawn thus far were
utterly exhausted, quite unable to go any
farther.</p>

<p>Matters had reached this stage, when
Moore rode up, and in a moment he
grasped the state of the case. It was a
question between sacrificing guns and
treasure, or running the risk that his
rear-guard should be cut off by the enemy.
Moore did not hesitate. He turned to
Roy, who happened at that moment to
be the nearest junior officer, and said
decisively, pointing to the edge of the
precipice—</p>

<p>“Take those carts and guns to the
brink, and roll them over.”</p>

<p>“Sir, it is money!” exclaimed one
present in consternation.</p>

<p>“So are shot and shell,” replied
Moore.</p>

<p>Roy promptly carried out the order,
and, under the energetic action of his
men, both guns and treasure soon went
plunging down the depth—out of sight
of the French advance-guard, which only
five minutes later passed this very spot.
They, however, did not know what had
just taken place. Moore’s hope, that the
money might in the end fall into Spanish
instead of into French hands, was fulfilled.
Some Spanish peasants found it
not long after.</p>

<p>On January 5th, at Constantino, much
fighting took place; and in the evening
a heavy trouble fell upon Roy.</p>

<p>Jack was missing!</p>

<p>All searching failed to find him; all
inquiries brought no result. Among
the sick and the wounded Roy went,
alone or with Jack’s friend, George
Napier, but in vain. On the field,
amid the slain, he hunted, torch in
hand; and as he turned up face after
face of those who had fallen, finding
<i>not</i> Jack’s features, a low-breathed
“Thank God!” again and again
escaped him. The only explanation
seemed to be that Jack was surely
taken prisoner.</p>

<p>At Lugo the whole Army was halted.
The march thither had been severe,
through deep mud and pelting rain,
with much suffering and fatigue. Collision
here again took place between the
English and French, and Moore in
person led his troops, sending the
enemy flying with heavy loss.</p>

<p>Then, during two days, he offered
battle to the French; and hardly was
his intention known, before the whole
British Army presented, as by magic,
a changed look. Stragglers came
hurrying in, the ranks were filled up,
and all were in the highest spirits, eager
for a fight.</p>

<p>But though the British were by this
time reduced to only nineteen thousand—three
thousand having been sent under
General Crauford by another route to
Vigo, and many having fallen out by
the way<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—yet Soult, with his greatly
superior numbers, did not respond.
The lack of provisions made it impossible
for Moore to delay longer.</p>

<p>While in the neighbourhood of Lugo,
Roy found time to add a few words to
his unfinished letter to Molly.</p>


<p class="p2 right">
“Jan. 6th. Near Lugo.
</p>

<p>“We had yesterday a sharp brush
with the Enemy, after reaching this;
and I am sorely put about, for Jack has
vanished. When last I set eyes on him,
he was well in advance of his Company,
waving his sword, and shouting to us to
come on. And come on we did, and
put the Enemy to rout; yet Jack may
have fallen into their hands. I with
others searched in every direction, both
among those who were wounded and
those who were killed; but, thank God,
Jack was not among them. He must
therefore, I fear, be prisoner. This
sheet I will not send off, even should
opportunity offer, until I know as to
Jack. I w<sup>d</sup> not awake Polly’s fears for
naught. He may even yet turn up again
unharmed. We rest here for two days.”</p>


<p class="p2">Roy wrote these words by the light of
a small lamp, lying flat upon the ground
in a bare little hut, which he occupied
while at Lugo. Some slight movement,
as of one coming in, made him glance
up, with a spring of hope. Had Jack
returned?</p>

<p>A tall cloaked figure quietly entered.
Roy leaped to his feet as if he had
received an electric shock, his bewildered
gaze encountering the last face that he
would have expected to see at that
moment—a face pale, tried and stern,
with the dark steadfast eyes which never
yet had flinched before life’s battles.
They did not flinch now, meeting this
heaviest of all trials to one of Moore’s
temperament—having to retire before his
Country’s foes.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The last three years had brought
sharp discipline to John Moore. Strain
had followed strain; disappointment
had followed disappointment; while
still through all his dauntless spirit had
risen superior to every opposition. But
the sufferings of his men upon this march
went to his very heart; and the partial
loss of discipline, in a force of which he
had been so justly proud, cut him to the
quick. Despite everything, he was as
a rule not calm only, but serene. Yet
now and again a shadow of deep though
passing sadness would fall upon him, as
at this moment.</p>

<p>Something in that face appealed
keenly to the young Ensign’s sympathies.
Then in a flash dread seized upon Roy.
What might this visit portend? Moore
<i>could</i> rebuke his subordinates scathingly—crushingly—when
necessity arose.
Roy felt that death would be far preferable
to any words of stern reproof
from those lips. But he had not consciously
failed in his duty. Could it,
perhaps, mean ill news of Jack?</p>

<p>Sir John glanced round before
speaking.</p>

<p>“Not too luxurious quarters, Baron,”
he remarked, and his smile lacked its
usual brilliance.</p>

<p>“Good enough, sir!” replied Roy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">{468}</a></span>
with the prompt cheerfulness which from
the first had marked him out in Moore’s
eyes. “If only Captain Keene——”</p>

<p>“Ay! You are anxious about
Keene.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ve been able to find out
nothing.”</p>

<p>“So Napier informed me. I was
passing this way, and I have looked in
to tell you. He is prisoner.”</p>

<p>Roy drew one hasty breath. Till that
moment he had not realised how heavily
the fear had weighed upon him of other
than imprisonment. To be aware that
Jack was still in the land of the living
meant much.</p>

<p>“Two French prisoners brought in
this afternoon have told us about him.
His leg was wounded and his right arm
broken, and when helpless he was taken.
Already, they say, he has been sent some
distance beyond their lines.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir!”—gratefully. “I’m
glad to know. It might have been
worse.”</p>

<p>“You are writing home, perhaps.
Make light of his wounds. I hope he is
not in any danger.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I am writing to my
sister.”</p>

<p>Moore stood for a few seconds, lost in
deep thought. Then, glancing up, he met
the concerned gaze of Roy’s frank grey
eyes. Not frank only, not concerned
only, but full of unmistakable boyish
adoration. In response, Moore’s hand
was laid on Roy’s arm, with one of those
quick gestures of overflowing kindness,
which went far to enthral the hearts of
those about him.</p>

<p>“I hear no report of you but what is
good. Keep on as you have begun.
You are treading worthily in Ivor’s
steps.”</p>

<p>Roy’s power of speech failed him,
with something which went far beyond
ordinary joy. This—from Moore himself!
Despite Jack’s misfortunes, Roy’s
world grew instantly radiant.</p>

<p>Moore smiled again at the boy’s look,
yet he sighed. There were some in
his force, and not young fellows only,
of whom he could not have spoken in
such terms—some who gave the rein
to bitter discontent at having to retreat,
and who did not do their utmost to
preserve discipline. But they were not
in the Reserve.</p>

<p>“We may hear of Keene again before
long. Give your letter to Napier, and it
shall go with the first despatches that
are sent on.”</p>

<p>Then he was gone. Roy, after seeing
him off, drew out the latest page of his
scribbled journal-notes, that he might
write down those priceless words, while
they were fresh in his mind. Not that
he ever would or ever could forget them.
But some day he would show them to
his father and mother—to Denham—to
Molly.</p>

<p>Having thus turned anew to his
journalising, he found time for two more
brief entries during days following.</p>


<p class="p2 right">
“Jan. 8. Near Lugo.
</p>

<p>“Nothing further as to Jack. I fear
that for a while I shall see and know no
more of him. I wonder much where
he may be sent. Both yesterday and
to-day General Moore has challenged
the French to battle; but they do not
accept his challenge.</p>

<p class="right">
“Jan. 10. Betanzos.
</p>

<p>“We came hither by a night-march
from Lugo, thus evading the French,
who w<sup>d</sup> seem to have been somewhat
awed by Sir John’s fearless defiance
of ’em at Lugo. For some hours our
rear-guard was not Harassed as usual,
and the Enemy’s advanced guard did
not get up with us till twenty-four
hours or more after our start. Since
we left our camp-fires burning, they
doubtless did not know till dawn that we
had given them the slip. It may be too
that, after that defiance, they were in no
vast hurry to follow.”</p>


<p class="p2">On the day following this entry, the
11th of January, Coruña was reached.</p>

<p>As they drew near to the coast,
Moore, quitting at last his post with the
Reserve, went forward, passing regiment
after regiment, and anxiously scanning
the distant sea for the transports which
he hoped to find in waiting.</p>

<p>But they were not there.</p>

<p>During the greater part of a fortnight
he had been incessantly at work, conducting
this arduous retreat, bringing
his Army through dangers and difficulties
innumerable. Perpetual fighting had
been the order of the day. Yet not once
had the Regiments of the Reserve, either
horse or foot, been beaten; not once had
the rear-guard quailed.</p>

<p>Some seventy or eighty thousand
soldiers, trained veterans of Napoleon,
at first under Napoleon himself, and
then under two of his most experienced
commanders, had striven hard to overtake
Moore, to outflank him, to cut off
his little force of twenty-three thousand
men. But they had been baffled.</p>

<p>More than two hundred and fifty
miles of rough country had been traversed,
in bleakest winter weather; and
the Army reached Coruña, somewhat
lessened in numbers, it is true, yet
absolutely unbroken. And though baggage
had had to be abandoned or destroyed,
for lack of means to convey it
further, though a few small cannon had
had to be left behind for the same
reason, not a single British gun had
been captured in fight, not a single
standard or military trophy of any kind
had been taken.</p>

<p>In after years there were men who
lightly criticised this retreat, calling it
needless, and wondering why Moore
had not made a stand, or had not continued
his advance.</p>

<p>Small wonder was it that Charles
Napier, who in the Reserve had gone
through the whole, and who from actual
knowledge understood it all, should, in
the face of these after-criticisms, break
into bitter and passionate words in
defence of that beloved Chief, under
whose eyes he had fought. And though
he was somewhat hard upon the people
of England, not only because they had no
means of knowing the true state of affairs,
but because also it was but a section of
them who criticised thus, yet one can
well understand what he must have felt.</p>

<p>“Had Moore sacrificed an Army,
instead of saving one, he would have
been perfect in the eyes of his country.
Nothing but his unpardonable humanity,
which made him fancy England cared
as much for her soldiers as he did,
caused him to act as he did act. Had
he saved his own life, and contrived to
have twenty thousand bayoneted—and
I firmly believe he was the only man in
our Army who could have saved us—he
would have done a job for which
England would have made him anything
he wished. Alas, for himself, he thought
of everything but himself! Fortunately,
another Hero has come up. But we
want both!”</p>

<p>So wrote Charles Napier, himself one
of England’s Heroes.</p>

<p class="ph3">PRACTICAL AIDS TO THE CULTURE OF LILIES.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> CHARLES PETERS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> years ago the culture of the lily
received a great impetus from the arrival in
England of “the golden-rayed lily of Japan.”</p>

<p>Some bulbs were sent over to us from Japan
which were said to be of a very large lily
which grows wild upon the Japanese Islands.</p>

<p>Fabulous prices were charged for the bulbs,
and of those who had paid through their teeth
for these rare bulbs very few obtained any
recompense.</p>

<p>The first consignment was a failure, but
the gorgeousness of the plant was sufficient
inducement to the Japanese growers to send
over another batch.</p>

<p>The bulbs rapidly became cheaper, and the
lily at once rose to a foremost position amongst
garden plants.</p>

<p>The <i>Lilium Auratum</i>, or golden-rayed lily,
is perhaps the most popular member of the
genus. Its flowers are immense, indeed, it
has the largest flowers of all the lilies. Of
fine colour, producing many flowers on each
stem, of great hardiness and of moderate ease
to cultivate, it is not surprising that this lily
should have attained its high popularity.</p>

<p>The <i>Lilium Auratum</i> is the most variable of
all the lilies. There are eight named varieties.
But even these are liable to considerable
variation. If you were to plant one hundred
bulbs, probably not more than three or four
would be absolutely similar.</p>

<p>This extreme variability is very remarkable,
when we remember that this lily is a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">{469}</a></span>
flower, but rarely cultivated until recently
either in Japan or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Vast numbers of the bulbs of this species
are sent over to England from Japan every
year, so that the species is by no means
difficult to obtain. The bulbs are large,
heavy, and if good, they are very
compact. They are of a yellowish or
purplish colour.</p>

<p>When you buy bulbs of <i>L. Auratum</i>,
do not go for the mammoth bulbs.
These are very rarely the best, though
always the most expensive. Buy small,
very heavy bulbs, and purchase them
from November to January.</p>

<p>The shoots of <i>L. Auratum</i> begin to
show about the middle of March, though
this lily, as indeed is every other, is
very variable in this respect. The
season has a lot to do with it. In a
warm rainy year the shoots often appear
in February. The time when the bulb
was planted and the depth at which it
was placed also affect the time at which
the lily shows above the soil.</p>

<p>When the shoot has appeared, it
grows with great rapidity. We had a
specimen in our garden which grew
nine feet in twelve weeks! You could
almost see it grow!</p>

<p>In connection with the shoots of lilies,
there is an important point to notice,
which is often overlooked and leads to
misconception, unless it is fully appreciated.
Lily shoots present extraordinary
differences. The shoot of <i>L.
Umbellatum</i> or <i>L. Candidum</i>, when it
first appears, is like an exceedingly
thick head of asparagus. From this
many people imagine that if a lily shoot
is not thick and solid, it is not going to
produce a flower. This opinion is quite
wrong. Some lilies, especially <i>L. Speciosum</i>,
never start with a thick shoot,
but show above ground as a thin lanky
growth.</p>

<p><i>L. Auratum</i> begins as a thin shoot, but it
rapidly gains in size and strength if circumstances
are favourable.</p>

<p>As in every other particular, <i>L. Auratum</i>
is exceedingly variable in the height to which
the stem grows. We have had in our garden
bulbs from the same source, planted at the
same time, in the same soil and position.
They have all flowered well, yet some are
only thirty inches high, while others tower
to the height of nine feet!</p>

<p>The golden-rayed lily does not show its
flower-buds until the stem is almost fully
grown. The buds are borne on long stalks,
each furnished with a single bract. From one
to forty buds are produced on each stem.</p>

<p>The leaves of this species are long and
linear in the type, but in the variety <i>Platyphyllum</i>
they are very broad. There are
rarely more than thirty or forty leaves, which
are of a deep glossy green.</p>

<p>We have followed the lily to the stage
when its buds become apparent. The next
chapter in its history is too often one of
mishaps. The strain on the plant at this
stage must be enormous, and it is no wonder
that such a large number of plants die at this
time.</p>

<p>The buds develop quickly until they become
the size of a large capsicum. Then they
change colour, and if the weather is dry, they
open in about a week.</p>

<p>Rain at the flowering time is the greatest
enemy to this lily.</p>

<p>What a magnificent object is the <i>L. Auratum</i>
when in full blossom! How beautiful is the
wide open perianth! And what a size! Ten
inches across, at the least, and fully a foot
when measured from the tips of the petals!
How elegantly do the goffered segments
curl round at their tips! The brilliant stripe
of golden yellow running down each segment,
which has given the flower its name, is exceedingly
characteristic; and the brownish
purple spots, curiously elevated and in places
raised into a distinct spine, relieve the pure
white of the background.</p>

<p>Proceeding from the centre of the flower
are the seven greenish threads which constitute
the floral organs. Each is armed with a deep
brown extremity, the pistil with a trefoil,
and the six stamens with crescents!</p>

</table></div>

<p>As we have said before, the flowers of <i>L.
Auratum</i> are sometimes extremely numerous.
We saw one plant last summer (we believe
at the Royal Gardens, Kew) of one of the
varieties of this species which bore
thirty-seven well-developed blossoms.</p>

<p>But it is not the prize specimens
of <i>L. Auratum</i> which are the most
beautiful. Plants bearing four to six
blossoms give the finest effects, for here
each flower has room to fully expand,
and so the extreme elegance of the
blossoms can be appreciated. In plants
bearing twenty or thirty blossoms on
the other hand, the general effect from
a distance is one of extreme luxuriance;
but on closer examination the effect is
not so striking, for the individual blossoms
cannot be perfectly formed, and
the result is often bizarre and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><i>L. Auratum</i> has an extremely strong
scent, which though pleasant in the
garden is far too overpowering in a
room.</p>

<p>In no lily does one meet with such
great variety as in this species. The
blossoms are exceedingly variable; but
there are some varieties which are sufficiently
marked and constant to have
gained special names.</p>

<p>There are eight named varieties of
<i>L. Auratum</i>, and the difference between
them is so striking that a person
without previous knowledge would take
them for separate species.</p>

<p>We append in tabular form the chief
differences between these eight varieties.</p>

<p>All these varieties are fine, and are
all worth growing; but some are expensive,
and some are very difficult to
cultivate.</p>

<p>Of all the varieties we prefer that
known as <i>Platyphyllum</i>. Its fine large
foliage, immense and gorgeous blossoms,
and its hardy constitution, make
this lily the most desirable of all. Indeed,
we would put a well-grown sample of <i>L. Auratum
Platyphyllum</i> in its perfection as the
most beautiful of all the vegetable productions
of our planet.</p>

<p>A few years ago <i>L. Auratum Platyphyllum</i>
was a very rare lily; but last year this lily did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">{470}</a></span>
exceedingly well, and consequently very good
bulbs can now be obtained at a cheap rate.
All over the country this variety did well last
year, and many were the correspondents who
wrote in enthusiastic measures to the various
papers about this wonderful plant, which not
a few of the writers imagined they had
discovered.</p>

<p>The variety <i>Wittei</i> is a most beautiful one,
but it is difficult to grow, and is moreover
rather expensive.</p>

<p>The red varieties of <i>L. Auratum</i> are fine in
their way, but are a little crude in colour and
not altogether satisfactory.</p>

<p>The cultivation of <i>L. Auratum</i> and its
varieties does not present much difficulty.
A well-drained peaty soil with plenty of sand
suits it well; but the soil must not be too
loose. A few lumps of clay may be placed
round the plants if the soil is too sandy.</p>

<p>No manure should be placed near the bulbs,
but a good dressing of rich old manure may
be applied to the plants with advantage as
soon as the shoots are a foot high.</p>

<p>If grown in a good soil and looked after
carefully, <i>L. Auratum</i> does not degenerate,
but increases and improves year after year.
Both the type and the varieties are perfectly
hardy.</p>

<p>The varieties are not all equally easy to
grow. <i>Platyphyllum</i>, <i>Macranthum</i>, and
<i>Rubro-Vittatum</i> are as easy, if not easier,
to grow than the type. <i>Wittei</i> and <i>Virginale</i>
are very difficult to do well with.</p>

<p>The two hybrids mentioned in the table will
be described later on.</p>

<p>All the varieties of <i>L. Auratum</i> make
excellent pot-plants.</p>

<p>The lily which bears the title of <i>Speciosum</i>,
or showy, was formerly the most admired
member of the genus. Even at the present
day this lily is looked upon by many as being
the finest. Personally we cannot concur with
this opinion. There is a certain falseness
about its blossoms and a hardness in their
shape which to our minds places it far below
<i>L. Auratum</i> for beauty.</p>

<p>Yet there can be no question that <i>Lilium
Speciosum</i> is a very fine plant. It has a
tremendous number of points in its favour
which must not be overlooked by the flower-grower.</p>

<p><i>L. Speciosum</i> flowers late in the year,
usually at the end of September, a time
when showy flowers are not numerous; too
late for summer blossoms, but too early for
chrysanthemums.</p>

<p>Although this lily is supposed to be tender,
it is perfectly hardy in England. The blossoms,
which are produced very freely, are not so much
injured by rain at their flowering time as are
most lilies. Deformity of the flowers is not
very common, and the peculiar shape of the
blossoms renders any slight deformity which
may be present of little consequence.</p>

<p>Another point in favour of this lily is that
instead of degenerating, it increases rapidly,
blossoms every year, and gives scarcely any
trouble.</p>

<p><i>L. Speciosum</i> is a native of Japan. Both
in its native land and elsewhere this lily has
been cultivated for years. There is now an
immense number of named varieties of this
plant; but, unfortunately, there are very many
more names than there are distinct varieties.</p>

<p>Probably the variety we call <i>Rubrum</i> is the
type of the species.</p>

<p>The bulbs of <i>L. Speciosum</i> are large with
loose scales. The flower spike is not often so
evident in the bulb as it is with most lilies.
The bulbs vary a good deal in colour from
white to deep purple; but the colour of the
bulb is no criterion as to the colour of the
blossoms. In the variety known as <i>Kraetzeri</i>
the bulbs are usually yellow.</p>

<p>This lily first sees the light as a thin, lanky
shoot. In fact, those who have grown other
lilies but not <i>Speciosum</i> would at once pronounce
a perfectly healthy shoot of this lily to
be “blind.”</p>

<p>When we first grew <i>L. Speciosum</i>, and
saw the feeble-looking shoots appear, we
felt certain that they would not blossom. But
fortunately we were mistaken in this surmise,
for they did blossom, and they blossomed well.</p>

<p>The stem of <i>L. Speciosum</i> is thin but very
flexible. Indeed, the lily rarely needs a stick,
as it bends before the wind. We have never
had the stem of one of these lilies broken.</p>

<p>The leaves are broader than is usually the
case in this genus. They somewhat resemble
the leaves of <i>L. Auratum Platyphyllum</i>.</p>

<p>The flower buds grow out from the main
stem, and when they are fully grown they are
furnished with very long stalks. This enables
us to cut the flowers singly—which is very
desirable, for one can take flowers from a
single plant for some weeks, removing each
as it opens.</p>

<p>The flowers themselves are about five inches
across, with the segments very much recurved
and the edges beautifully curled. The colour
varies from pure white to deep crimson with
white edges. A green line, deeply sunk, runs
down the centre of each segment, being broad
at the attachments and narrowing to a point
about half way down. These six green lines
give the appearance of a green star, which is
highly characteristic. It is most evident in
the white varieties, and especially so in the
variety called <i>Kraetzeri</i>. The petals which
are broadest about their centre are roughened
with numerous spines and tubercles. The
pollen is brown.</p>

<p>The scent of this lily resembles that of
chocolate creams. It is not very powerful in
any of the varieties, while some forms are
apparently scentless.</p>

<p>The varieties of <i>L. Speciosum</i> may be
grouped under the headings of white, rose,
red, and purple kinds.</p>

<p>All the white varieties are fine. <i>Lilium
Speciosum Album Kraetzeri</i>, notwithstanding
its big name, is the smallest of the white
forms. But though small, it is extremely
delicate in colour and shape. The green star
is very conspicuous. It is, however, rather
tender and requires a certain amount of care
to cultivate properly.</p>

<p>Of the rose varieties, the “Opal” and the
“Rose” are undoubtedly the finest. The
former is the more beautiful in colour, but the
blossoms are rather thin and straggling.</p>

<p>The old <i>Rubrum</i> is the best of the red
varieties. It is the most prolific of all the
varieties.</p>

<p>The deepest coloured of all is a Japanese
variety, <i>Melpomone</i>. This is a very fine big
flower. Its colour is blood-crimson, spotted
and bordered with white. The exterior of the
blossoms is pale pink. <i>Rubro-Cruentum</i> and
<i>Purpureum</i> are other fine purple varieties.
They differ very slightly from <i>Melpomone</i>.</p>

<p>Some forms of <i>L. Speciosum</i> in which the
stem splits into two or three parts are
called monstrous or corymbiform varieties.
There are white, red, and purple monstrous
forms. They are inferior to the ordinary
varieties.</p>

<p>But little need be said of the cultivation of
<i>L. Speciosum</i>. Where <i>L. Auratum</i> will
grow, <i>L. Speciosum</i> will grow; and it will
grow in most places where <i>L. Auratum</i> will
not grow. It likes a peaty soil with plenty
of sand. Water must be given freely during
growth.</p>

<p><i>L. Speciosum</i> makes an excellent pot plant,
and is grown by many people in their conservatories.
In fact, it shares the honour with
<i>Lilium Harrisii</i> of being the only lily commonly
grown under glass. As a cut flower it
is very useful.</p>

<p>Just a word about cutting lilies. Never
cut the stem down near the ground. Always
leave about twenty leaves, else the bulb may
suffer.</p>

<p>If you are going to bring lilies up to town
from the country, cut the buds off just before
they open. These stand less risk of damage
in moving, and they will open perfectly if
placed in water.</p>

<p>Cut lilies are thirsty plants and need a lot
of water. They last from one to two weeks
if plentifully watered, but die almost immediately
when water is withheld. We have
before warned you against spoiling your lilies
by removing the anthers.</p>

<p>A lovely little lily is <i>Lilium Krameri</i>. The
delicate pink of its blossoms, its slender growth,
its early flowering, and its fragrance render it
worthy of a place in every garden.</p>

<p>Like most of the lilies we have described,
<i>L. Krameri</i> hails from Japan. In most
particulars it resembles a little <i>L. Auratum</i>,
but its flowers are totally different from any
other species. They are about four inches
across, of a waxy white to deep blush pink
colour. The anthers are brown.</p>

<p>This lily flowers in June. It is not easy to
do well with. It is rather tender and very
susceptible to early frosts. Its cultivation is
similar to that of <i>L. Auratum</i>.</p>

<p>Last year there was exhibited in London
flowers of a new lily somewhat resembling
<i>L. Krameri</i>. It flowered at Kew in June,
and we were fortunate enough to flower a
specimen in our own garden. This new
species has received the name of <i>Lilium
Rubellum</i>, and, though it resembles <i>L.
Krameri</i>, it is undoubtedly a true species.</p>

<p>The flowers are small (our one was two and
a half inches across), the petals have the
tissue-paper look like a <i>Cistus</i> instead of the
waxy appearance presented by most lilies.
The colour is a full rich pink, and the anthers
are yellow.</p>

<p>Its cultivation is similar to that of the other
<i>Archelirions</i>.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">t</span> was delightful to
feel that we
would soon be
once more in
comfortable
quarters, with
room for order
and cleanliness.
The
Californian
dust is perfectly
impossible
to deal with
in such conditions
as the
barn afforded,
or as would be
involved in
camping.</p>

<p>While we
were still living
in our little
house in San Miguel, I had seen one or two
camping parties returning after an absence of
ten days or a fortnight in the mountains, and
had wondered, with dismay, what could have
happened to the women and men of the
party, that they should look as though their
persons and clothes had been rolled, and
soaked, and stewed in the grey dust. Now
I understood only too well. Soon, all the
plastering was finished, and we were looking
for the painters, who arrived, unfortunately,
in the midst of another desert wind.</p>

<p>The head painter was a Norwegian, and
though a very good workman, he was absolutely
dense about colour. All day, in the
midst of that howling hot wind, we struggled
with him to get the tones we wanted, he
becoming more and more depressed and
obstinate, and we more feverish and anxious.
The carpenters looked on with amused interest,
expecting, so they said afterwards, “that
someone would have to be pulled off somebody!”
However, before the twilight came
down on us, we had evolved some delicate
shades that would pass, and were thankful to
creep into the barn and rest if we could,
knowing that we must be up betimes to-morrow,
to see that the Norwegian did not
make any mistake.</p>

<p>On Sundays, when the men were free, they
generally went off hunting for honey. They
were very clever at finding the nests of the
wild bees, and were very much in earnest on
these expeditions, having fashioned for themselves
extraordinary headgear and gauntlets,
like armour in a comic opera, as a protection
against stings. They made, too, quite an
ingenious contrivance for running the clear
honey out of the comb, and sold this and the
wax for a nice little sum. Liza used to look
after them with longing, envious eyes; they
were so much more successful than she in
their hunting. But then they used dynamite
when the nest was behind some great rock,
and she with all her savage strength could
not remove the stones unaided. But though
they were kind, friendly fellows, and almost
all men in this wild West are particularly
nice to women, they never asked her to join
them.</p>

<p>The architect who came out regularly from
town, during the building of the house, and
closely superintended every detail, was a more
welcome comrade to them. He joined them
in their expeditions, and lent us too a helping
hand.</p>

<p>Our ranchman was absent on some business
connected with his land, and we were very
much puzzled as to who was to milk the cow;
we ourselves had not yet learned, and none of
the carpenters could help us, though they
would have been very willing. When our
friend the architect heard of our difficulty, he
at once exclaimed that he would milk the
cow. And so he did in the most business-like
and thorough manner.</p>

<p>The carpenters were very like boys when
working hours were over, and I remember
one evening, when the building of the house
was almost finished, and they were to return
to town in a few days, we were all startled by
hearing a terrific report, somewhere quite
close at hand. Everyone rushed out into
the beautiful starlight to know what disaster
had happened, and then we found Mr. Scott
gravely remonstrating with the men, who were
looking very sheepish. It seems that finding
they had quite a store of dynamite over from
their bee-hunting, they determined to set it
all off together for their own amusement.
They had not expected quite so much noise,
and were apologetic. Mr. Scott turned to
my husband and said with a disgusted air,
“Some of them carpenters has more powder
than brains!”</p>

<p>The day had come at last, when we were
to move into our house. I sent my darkey
back to town, and was delighted to see the
last of her, even though I had failed to find
anyone to replace her. I had, however, the
help of a young Englishman, who had left a
clerkship in the Corporation offices at Liverpool,
and come out to rough it in California,
glad of the open air life, and glad too of the
change of work, though it happened, as at
present, to include such jobs as digging out
a rain water cistern, and acting as temporary
scullery maid.</p>

<p>However inexperienced he was at this last
work, he was willing and pleasant, which was
a delightful change from the “gorilla.”</p>

<p>The carpenters helped us to move in the
heaviest pieces of furniture, and I think I shall
never forget the luxury of that first night
when we slept in the house—it was so airy,
and fresh, and cool.</p>

<p>We were very busy for many days after,
putting all in order, but it was delightful work
to us, however tiring, for the house was
lovely and comfortable beyond all our expectations,
and now that all the old furniture was
standing about us, dusted and polished, and
almost smiling, it felt so homelike and friendly
that we seemed no longer like strangers in a
strange land.</p>

<p>Now occurs an opportunity to tell some of
our “domestic help” experiences. We feared
that our place would be too lonely for a
Chinaman; the nearest Celestial within reach
was at a ranch some five miles away, and
though there was quite an active centre of
Chinese life and light at the laundry gentleman’s
shanty at the village of El Barco, still
that was six miles away, and Chinamen are
bad walkers, and few of them can drive.
Also, their wages are very high, thirty dollars
to thirty-five dollars a month being the lowest;
some of them get as much as fifty dollars and
sixty dollars a month. So we thought we
would try our luck with a woman servant; we
could talk our own language to her and lend
her books, which would overcome, to some
extent, the loneliness of the life for her, and we
would only have to pay her twenty to twenty-five
dollars a month.</p>

<p>Our first was an American girl; her
manners were new to us, but not refreshing.
We did not keep her long, for she proved to
have something wrong with her heart, and
could neither stoop nor carry any slight
weight without turning blue in the face. The
boys did not take to her. She would saunter
into the dining-room when it was time to
lay the cloth, and if I were not there, she
would take up one of the papers on the table,
and either stand very much at her ease reading
it, or sit down to it, often at the same time
using a toothpick. Or she would slap my
sons on the shoulder, saying, “Now then,
boys, clear out!”</p>

<p>I was not able to go into town this time,
so I telegraphed to my friend at the agency
office, a nice helpful Irishman, who always did
his best for me.</p>

<p>Though the little village of El Barco has
but a scattered population of about two
hundred, they have had a telephone into San
Miguel for many a year. So I sent a message
asking for a servant of some kind at twenty-five
dollars a month. In answer, my Irish
friend asked, would I be willing to try a
nigger, adding that he was not very black!
He knew my feelings about the “gorilla.”
When I heard further that he was a willing,
pleasant-spoken fellow, with a very good
character for honesty, I agreed to try him.
So he was sent out by the evening train. We
became quite fond of him, and though he
knew very little about cooking, he was
exceedingly quick at learning, and was very
capable in other ways, and so obliging that
much could be forgiven him. He had great
pride in all he learnt, and liked to know the
proper orthodox names of the different dishes,
though he could never conquer the word
rissole, but always called it “free soul!” He
had left his wife and family in Tennessee,
where he had formerly kept a dairy farm, but
his health had failed, and he was threatened
with lung trouble; so he came to this sunny
climate, and hoped to be able to send for
them to join him before very long.</p>

<p>As he could not read or write, I was his
secretary, and had often great difficulty in
keeping a grave face when reading his home
letters. They were a jumble of revival meetings,
the arrival of families of young pigs,
names of different neighbours who had “got
religion,” and advice as to how he was to
make the bread for us, finishing up with
“howdies” from everyone. It often took
me quite a long time to puzzle them out.
However we soon began to teach him to write
and read, and he was so quick in learning
that before he left us he was quite independent
of my help in his correspondence. His worst
drawback was the colour of his hands, which
being a kind of neutral grey brown, never let
him know clearly whether they were dirty or
clean, and I soon found his finger marks on
many treasures. However, such things are
trifles in this life, and I should have kept
him till this day, I believe, but that, in an
evil moment, we again made the experiment
of getting a woman servant from the old
country.</p>

<p>The woman we had heard of was willing to
pay her own passage out, for the sake of the
£70 wage which she could never hope to get
at home; so we engaged her and let our little
nigger go.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">hen</span> Lucy
Challoner
found herself
shut
into one of
those “secret
pavilions,”
which God
erects so
often in the
heart of
life’s storms—quiet
resting-places
into which
neither the
tempest
which is
overpast,
nor the
after-swells
which are to come, can find entrance.
The tossed heart is hushed like that
of a little child, and looking neither
before nor after, is content with the
peace and the benediction of the passing
hour.</p>

<p>It was cheering to see how the sea-breeze
brought healthy tints to Charlie’s
pale face, while every hour found him
stronger and more fit to throw aside
the little physical frailties which hang
about one after a great illness.</p>

<p>For the first day of their visit they
were content with one little stroll on
the pier, and then they sat at their
window discovering endless interest in
the fact that “Lloyd’s” station was in
the house next but one to theirs, so
that every ship which hove in sight
became voluble in nautical signs. Then
their walks grew longer, extending ever
further down the shingly shore.</p>

<p>“Now, Lucy,” said Mr. Challoner,
“was not I right to come here instead
of to any mere invalid resort? Why, it
lifts up one’s soul—and one’s body with
it—just to look at these Deal boatmen.
They’re so ready to give their lives for
you if need be, that a kind of exhalation
of health comes from them.”</p>

<p>Before they left Deal, Lucy Challoner
not only fully approved of her husband’s
choice as for himself, but felt
convinced that he had made his choice
for her too, and with equal wisdom and
foresight.</p>

<p>As the days passed on, and Charlie
and his little boy made friends with
many of the old salts who lounge along
the shingle as if life was nothing but
the sea view (which seems reflected in
their very eyes), Lucy sometimes stayed
indoors and occupied herself with details
of her husband’s outfit. Her landlady
came in and out of the room, generally
silent, but cheerful and ready to respond
to advances.</p>

<p>“We can see the Goodwin Sands
very plainly to-day,” Lucy said once.
“What a terrible trap they are.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” Mrs. May answered.
“And if those in the other world know
aught about what’s done in this—and
why shouldn’t they?—I wonder how
those men feel who neglected to keep
down those sands, because they wanted
to build a big steeple instead of doing
their duty? On wild nights here, when
we’re almost certain poor souls are
going down by the score, I never can
help thinking o’ those others. It must
be mighty bad for them surely. And
yet maybe they didn’t know what they
were doing was so bad—or didn’t think!
I’d not make them out worse than most
of us, and we all need God our Saviour.
Maybe God lets ’em receive the poor
drowned souls, and comfort ’em and
care for ’em.”</p>

<p>“But is it true that the sands became
dangerous through neglect?” asked
Lucy. “I have heard the story, but I
have heard that geology has a different
word to say.”</p>

<p>Mrs. May shook her head slightly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, ma’am,” she said.
“I’m speaking as if the story be true.
And certain it is that men and money
have been able to do a good bit to lessen
the risks of the Sands as they are, and
it is a pity that they did not do it sooner.
And maybe they might do a great deal
more yet. I wish gentlemen in power
would think over such things instead
of wanting to spend money on guns to
kill poor folks in far-off countries. It’s
wonderful what has been left for private
folk to do before the others stir. I daresay
you’ve never heard of one Powell, of
Deal, living nigh two hundred years
ago?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Lucy reflecting, and
unable to recall any Powell of popular
memory, save Mary, the wilful wife of
the poet Milton.</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am,” said Mrs. May, with
a slight drawing-up of her neat figure.
“That Powell of Deal (my mother was
of the family, though, of course, generations
later), he seemed to be one of the
first to think of saving people off the
wrecks on the Sands. There were no
lifeboats in his time, you know.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Lucy assented. “There
were no lifeboats till nearly a hundred
years after that, and very few until about
seventy years ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, that Powell was Mayor of
Deal in those days, and pretty well off
for just a shopkeeper in the town—a
tailor and outfitter he was. And there
came a great storm one November night—it
was such a storm as never was. It
was the night the Eddystone Lighthouse
was destroyed along with the man that
built it, and people were killed in their
beds, even in grand houses, and the loss
of life and property was tremendous.
We can guess what it was on the
Goodwins, ma’am. There were thirteen
men-of-war wrecked, and hundreds of
men—more than a thousand—were
drowned. Then the people who were
watching from the shore saw that some
had got on the Goodwins, and there
they were sure to be washed away.”</p>

<p>Mrs. May paused and looked at Lucy
with emphatic eyes.</p>

<p>“So Powell, he could not bear it, and
he ordered out the custom-house boats,
and offered a reward of five shillings for
every sailor that should be saved. It
was not much, for he hadn’t much. They
say he went out himself. And two hundred
men were saved that otherwise must
have been drowned. And he took them
all into his care, and fed them and clothed
them. And though they were Royal
Navy men, he had a deal of bother and
loss of time before the Government
made up the money he was out of
pocket, which he could not afford to
lose. He seemed to be the very first to
show that it was anybody’s bounden
duty to save the drowning. But he’s
never been much talked of. The stories
of fighting and killing are the stories
that are told. He was only a tailor and
outfitter, you see, ma’am, and most
folks give such but a sneer. But my
mother brought all her children up to
remember him and to learn from him to
look out to see what their hands can
do. She used to say people laugh
at a tailor as the ninth part of a man;
but I say nine good men were rolled
into one in my great-great-uncle
Powell.”</p>

<p>“Then you have always lived in Deal,
I suppose?” asked Lucy, interested in
the sudden frankness of the hitherto
reserved woman.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; but I’ve been in
London,” she said.</p>

<p>“When your husband was living?”
Lucy inquired gently.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” replied Mrs. May.
“I married a Kingsdown man, a pilot.
His father’s still living in Kingsdown,
old and frail, but he’s saved people’s
lives by scores and scores. He has
been a great man in the lifeboat.”</p>

<p>“Did your husband ever go out in the
boat?” asked Lucy.</p>

<p>“He met his death in it,” said Mrs.
May quite calmly. “We hadn’t been
married a year, and it was the first time
he had ever gone out. It was the
Lord’s will that his father should go
again and again and do great things
and come home safe and sound, and be
living at eighty-five. But my Jarvist
was knocked over and washed away
before he could do anything. But the
Lord knew what Jarvist’s will was, and
the Lord took it for the deed.”</p>

<p>Mrs. May stood gazing out towards
the fateful line on the horizon. Lucy’s
eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. May,” she said, “how
hard it was for you! How could you
bear to go on living beside this cruel
sea in sight of that terrible place!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">{474}</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. May turned towards her with a
wistful smile.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she said, “how many ladies
have said that to me! (Not that I tell
everyone who comes, for some would
not care to hear. There are folks who
go out to picnic and dance on the
Goodwins!) But look here, dear,” she
went on eagerly, her last reserve melted
in Lucy’s tears, “we all see houses,
and yet somebody has died in every
house; we all see our beds, and yet
we’ve seen dear ones die on them, and
we look to die there ourselves some day.
It’s all hard just at first. After a while,
the thought of death settles into a bit of
life. It’s the Lord’s will that it comes
in one way to one and in another to
another. But it’s all right if it means
going to Him, and all we’ve got to do is
to keep on following.”</p>

<p>“And you had your husband such a
little time!” cried Lucy, thinking to
herself that she and Charlie had already
had more than seven years of happy life
together.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. May; “I was a
widow at twenty-five. I’m just fifty
now, and my people live long, so likely
I’ve got a good bit to go yet. I had
my Jarvist just for one year. But I
reckon that one year was quite enough
to soak through all the rest, back and
fore, just as a fine perfume does.</p>

<p>“I took it very hard at first,” she
went on. “I took it rebellious. But
Jarvist’s father he came to me, and says
he, ‘Joan’—and he put his hand on
my shoulder, and it had a kind of feeling
as if it pulled me up like—‘Joan,’ says
he, ‘Jarvist has done his part. Now
you’ve got to do yours. You married a
sailor, Joan; he’s died at his place,
you’ve got to live at yours. Don’t
make no fuss about it, lass,’ says he (he
speaks old-fashioned and homely), ‘you
won’t see Jarvist a day the sooner. You
wouldn’t have liked Jarvist to stay at
home to please you, would you?’ says
he. ‘And if he’d have done such a
mean thing, and yet his time were come,
then he’d have broke his neck a-trippin’
over a doormat,’ says the old man.
‘I’ll tell you something, Joan. Before
Jarvist went out he said to me, “Father,
if aught took me, you’d be good to
Joan.” We all thinks that to each
other,’ father-in-law says, ‘but the
young men—specially the new-married—they
generally says it once or twice
before they feel it’s taken for granted.
Said I back to Jarvist, “Joan’s a lass
with grit in her, and she’ll be good to
herself and to others, too, I reckon.”
And that was my promise to Jarvist for
you, Joan, and you’ve got to make it
good,’ says he. So I’ve tried to do.
That’s five-and-twenty years ago, and
time is passing on. It’s not so long
for any of us after all.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon for speaking so freely
to you, ma’am,” she went on after a
short pause, while Lucy’s tears dropped;
“but there’s a look in your face that if
you’d been a man would have sent you
out to the Goodwins. But the women
have to do their part at home—keeping
ready dry clothes and hot gruel sometimes,”
she added with a quiet laugh,
“as we did one day this spring, when
one poor soul was left wrecked on the
Goodwins after all his shipmates were
drowned. It was said the lifeboat
couldn’t go out; but then our men they
couldn’t stay in! Never shall I forget
that night at the little mariners’ service
where I often go. The gentleman that
was praying and reading the Scriptures
saw the men’s faces, and he broke short
off to say, ‘Can we go? Can we do
something?’ Why not? It was all in
the service of God. And they went, and
they brought off the man safely—a poor
Norwegian.”</p>

<p>Lucy had learned to fear contact with
strangers since her husband’s illness.
Their misjudged “sympathy,” their well-meant
comments, had so often been as
the rubbing of salt into the ever-open
wound of anxiety, and the almost tenderer
spot of hope. She had learned the lesson
that if the greatest consolation for sorrow
is to have beside us one who understands
it and shares it, then the next greatest
blessing is to be able to bear one’s
burden alone, apart from those to whom
one’s agony is but a spectacle or a
dumping ground for commonplaces.</p>

<p>But she found there was no need to
shrink from Mrs. May. When she confided
to the landlady the plans that were
in preparation, and the long separation
which was impending, Mrs. May was
full of encouraging hope. She could
narrate cases in which the sea, despite
its terrible side, had acted as a beneficent
healer and life restorer. She could
tell, too, of many who had suffered in the
same way as Mr. Challoner, and were
still alive—elderly people, with long useful
years behind them. To Lucy Challoner
this sort of cheer was the more
acceptable because it came to her surrounded
by an atmosphere, and supported
by a foundation, in which neither life nor
death were held to be the main things—but
only “the will of the Lord,” which
could make either death or life blessed
both to those who were left and to those
who were taken.</p>

<p>Very different was the tone of the
notes which came from Lucy’s sister
Florence. Mrs. Brand wrote a large
hand, so that a very few words covered
four sides of a sheet of note-paper; also
she wrote, as it were, breathlessly, dropping
pronouns and punctuation. She
was very forcible in bewailing her sister’s
departure to Deal—“So sudden—and
such a place—and didn’t Charlie feel the
journey—and it mightn’t be amiss if it
turned him aside from the bigger scheme—couldn’t
bear to think of it—poor dear
Lucy all alone—well, the child, of course—and
if for Charlie’s good, but it seemed
a great risk—wasn’t beginning to look
for a successor for Pollie yet; no good
being in hurry—better not hire anyone
till a day or two before wanted—and
Lucy not coming back to London till the
very night before Charlie sailed for the
North—who was Captain Grant?—hoped
he was a decent man—master mariners
not always up to much; but if Charlie
kept pretty well, perhaps he would not
mind about trifles. Must get word as
soon as they were sure of dates—must
get last look of Charlie—and had good
many evening engagements on. Poor
dear Lucy, Florence really pitied—things
had looked so different at Lucy’s marriage,
but might turn out better, even
yet.”</p>

<p>As Lucy read those notes, her pulse
used to quicken with a sense of revolt.
Charlie’s wife was no person to be
pitied! Come what might, she was not
to be pitied! Her anxieties, her possible
sorrows, were not to be regarded as so
much ill-luck, to be secretly contrasted
by Florence with her own splendid
fortune in stalwart, prosperous Jem, and
her showy house, and large “visiting
circle.”</p>

<p>After these rebellious sensations, Lucy
always turned penitent—said to herself
that she was silly and even wicked, and
resolved to allow no such feelings to
arise again. But Florence’s next note
always stirred them anew. The east
wind will ruffle us; we can but turn our
backs to it, or veil our faces, and afterwards
soothe the irritated skin with
emollients. So there are natures which
thus rush rudely on our souls. And we
cannot change those natures, or their
effect upon us; we can only avert the
worst results by tact, hide our soreness
in silence, and heal damages by patience
and forbearance. Let us put our conscious
misery to a good use by its keeping
us humbly aware that any sweetness
or amiability that we may seem to possess
belongs, after all, almost as much to our
environment as to ourselves!</p>

<p>The peaceful resting-time wore to an
end. Charlie Challoner and his little
boy had made friends with nearly all
the Deal “hovellers,” lounging so
easily on the shingly shore, watching
the sea and the sky, as if there were
nothing else to do in life, yet with the
strength of scores of conquered storms
wrought into their fine old faces. They
had heard many stories grave and gay,
and little Hugh had gathered up some
queer treasures in the way of uncommon
shells and stones, and even a little
carved boat.</p>

<p>Lucy herself did not talk much to the
old boatmen. Her happy relations with
Mrs. May had not overcome all her
shrinking from strangers, and she preferred
to hear of them from Charlie, and
to let him tell over their yarns to her.
But when she went out with her husband
they all gave her kindly greeting. It
was Lucy’s delighted pride that whoever
knew Charlie first seemed always ready
to welcome and approve of her. She
revelled in being regarded kindly for his
sake. Yet it was as often something of
her which had originally commended
him. He or she who is wrapped round
by a true and tender love carries its
grace everywhere.</p>

<p>After Charlie had had his pleasant
chats to some of those old men, the one
of them had said to the other—</p>

<p>“Reckon that gentleman’s got a good
woman belonging to him. Ye sort o’ feel
it on him, like ye smell the spicy breezes
before ye touch a port o’ the land where
spices grow.”</p>

<p>“Course he has,” said the other;
“haven’t ye seen her? A winsome lass—one
of the little craft that can go
through a great deal of rough weather—the
sort that’s generally made for that
purpose, to my thinking.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">{475}</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the last day before the
returning day.</p>

<p>“We will go for a long walk inland,”
said Charlie. “It will be my last sight
of English trees for a long while; and
if autumn has carried off some of
their beauty, it has added more of its
own.”</p>

<p>That afternoon Mrs. May announced
that she was going for a walk up to
Walmer Castle, and asked if the little
master might go with her. Hugh was
delighted—the sea was a perennial joy
to him—to whom country lanes did not
seem marvellously different from London
squares and parks. Lucy gratefully
assented. She never knew whether it
was an accident, or whether the kind
woman realised that she and Charlie
would be thankful for a quiet ramble and
an undisturbed conversation.</p>

<p>Perhaps they did not talk much
during that walk. Hearts were too full
and tears too near the surface. But
each uttered solemnly those expressions
of mutual love and faith which must
generally lie half hidden under the little
commonplaces of daily life. Each, as it
were, rendered back the mutual charge
of the other,—Charles promising faithfully
to take care of himself, and to
remember all the precautions Lucy
would insist on, if she were with him,—Lucy
pledging herself to keep as free
as possible from worrying, to remember
that, under all the circumstances, the
coming of letters must be more or less
uncertain and far between, adding a
voluntary clause that she would do her
very best to be brave and wise under any
unforeseen conditions which might arise,
and under which she could not seek
Charlie’s counsel and support. That
voluntary clause was due to Lucy’s
tender self-reproach against the household
secret that she was keeping, even
for her husband’s own sake. Charlie
received it, with assurances that he knew
she would keep her word. Little did
either of them then think how that
little pledge was to return to their
minds, to their common soothing and
upholding!</p>

<p>Lucy felt that this quiet hour of spiritual
nearness was their true farewell.
With its thrilling emotions would be
blent for ever the memory of the solemn
November afternoon sky—sunless, but
with suggestions of sunlight in its delicate
opal hues—and the square tower of Munceam
church, lifting its grey head from
a mass of foliage, glorious with vivid
autumn tints.</p>

<p>After that came the bustle of final
packing, the farewell to Mrs. May—to
whom Lucy felt she owed something
which was not included in her modest
bill—the railway journey, the return
home. The house was in apple-pie
order, and at this critical juncture
Charlie ceased to wonder at Pollie’s unrestrained,
fast-flowing tears. The
Brands “looked in” late that night in
evening dress on their way from a dinner-party.
Jem Brand talked loud and fast
to Charlie, while Florence patted her
sister’s hands and whispered that she
had not secured her a servant yet—they
would go about that business together—the
interest and excitement would be
cheering to Lucy’s loneliness—there
were still three or four days to pass
before Pollie left—plenty of time.</p>

<p>“Plenty of time!” Lucy echoed
absently. “What did it really matter?
Charlie was going away!”</p>

<p>Then it was over. Lucy came back
from seeing her husband on board the
Scotch steamer for Aberdeen. She felt
as if she had died, and had come to
life again in an emptied earth. How
strange the street noises sounded!
How strange the familiar house looked!
Even little Hugh seemed somehow
different!</p>

<p>Lucy had not experienced enough to
know that the worst was not yet. She
had still to expect her husband’s telegram
of his safe arrival in the north.
She could look forward to one or two
letters from him written from Peterhead.
And when these came, full of cheer, of
pleasant descriptions of scenery, fellow-passengers,
and friendly welcome, together
with good accounts of the dear
wanderer’s own progress towards
strength, poor Lucy began to feel as if
she had passed the sharpest corner of
her woe, and almost to congratulate herself
on her own bravery.</p>

<p>Alas, beyond “the strong pull” on
one’s courage and submission, there
comes “the long pull.”</p>

<h2><a name="THINGS_IN_SEASON_IN_MARKET_AND_KITCHEN" id="THINGS_IN_SEASON_IN_MARKET_AND_KITCHEN">THINGS IN SEASON, IN MARKET AND KITCHEN.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> LA MÉNAGÈRE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are several new additions to our
list. We have grass-lamb, mackerel, the first
salmon, salads, salad-herbs, cucumbers, spinach,
spring onions, turnip and nettle-tops, but as
yet no additional fruits. However, whilst we
have such an abundance of good rhubarb and
green salads, we have nothing to complain of,
for what can be better for health than these,
or more refreshing?—so welcome, too, after
the winter. Fresh mint, sorrel, chervil, and
water-cress add flavour to the bowl, and spring
onions give it piquancy.</p>

<p>People who suffer from sleeplessness should
try the effect of a sandwich of spring onions—bread
and butter with finely-minced onion
spread between—before retiring to rest. It is
said to be most soothing and sleep-inviting.</p>

<p>I would specially recommend these “green”
sandwiches to all who find a difficulty in eating
salad-herbs in any other form—for instance,
chopped mustard and cress, thinly-shaved
cucumber and onion, chopped parsley, mint
and sorrel—all are excellent when spread
between thin slices of buttered bread, and
very dainty, too, are they.</p>

<p>This is the month when we may begin one
of our favourite dishes of spinach and eggs—one
of our physic dishes, I might say, for on
very good authority we learn that spinach contains
more iron than almost anything else that
can be mentioned, and when combined with
the sulphur of the egg becomes a capital tonic
medicine. So by all means let us eat plenty of it.</p>

<p>I have mentioned mackerel as belonging to
the month of April. From now until the end
of June they will be prime, and are a good
fish to eat; but out of their proper season they
are not wholesome. Perhaps they are nicest
when carefully boiled and served with parsley
sauce; but if baked with butter and accompanied
by gooseberry sauce, or split open and
broiled, with herb sauce, they are very nearly
as good. Also they are excellent for breakfast
when pickled and eaten cold.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible this month to lay too
much stress on the virtues of salads; and to
prepare these well, to make as many varieties
of them as possible, and to mix the dressing
with due art, is well worth careful study on the
part of every housewife.</p>

<p>A perfectly plain dressing of salt, pepper,
vinegar and oil, if well beaten together, and
then a spoonful of good cream added, becomes
almost equal to a mayonnaise, and is not so
expensive or troublesome to make ready.</p>

<p>The following would be found a suitable
little dinner for this month, and it is easy to
vary at will:—</p>


<h3>MENU.</h3>


<ul class="center"><li>Cream of Spinach Soup.</li>
<li>Boiled Mackerel. Parsley Sauce.</li>
<li>Roast Lamb. Boiled Cucumber. Mint Sauce.</li>
<li>Spring Salad.</li>
<li>Rhubarb Fool. Sponge Custard Pudding.</li>
<li>Cheese Aigrettes.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Cream of Spinach Soup.</i>—Pick and wash a
quart of spinach, set it on to boil with enough
water to cover it, and a spoonful of salt; stew
a couple of young onions and a few herbs in a
separate vessel, and then rub all together
through a sieve until a green <i>purée</i> is obtained.
To this add a pint of hot milk, a spoonful of
cornflour wet with milk and an ounce of butter,
also seasoning to taste. Boil up once and serve.</p>

<p><i>Boiled Cucumber</i> is an agreeable change
amongst vegetables, and is very easy to do.
Pare the cucumber and cut it down lengthwise,
then across into inch-lengths; throw into
salted boiling water and cook ten minutes.
Drain well and serve with a little parsley
sprinkled over, or in melted butter sauce.</p>

<p><i>Rhubarb Fool.</i>—Cut up two or three bundles
of fresh rhubarb into short lengths, and stew
quickly with sugar until quite soft, then rub
through a sieve. Whip about a quarter of a
pint of thick cream and the whites of two eggs
together, with one or two tablespoonfuls of
castor sugar, and lightly whisk these up with
the fruit. Heap all in a bright glass dish.</p>

<p><i>Sponge Custard Pudding.</i>—Make a boiled
custard with the yolks of the two eggs, a pint
of milk, two ounces of castor sugar, grated
lemon rind for flavouring, and an ounce of
dissolved gelatine stirred in at the last. Half
fill a plain mould with sponge biscuits and
pour this custard on them whilst hot. Set
aside in a cold place until it is solid. The
rhubarb fool would also be improved by being
set on ice. Serve both together.</p>

<p><i>Cheese Aigrettes.</i>—Dissolve an ounce of
butter and stir into it a tablespoonful of flour;
add half a pint of warm milk, and stir over
the fire until a smooth paste is obtained.
Add whilst hot salt, cayenne pepper, and
grated cheese enough to give a strong flavour.
When getting cool mix in carefully the yolk
of a large fresh egg. Bring half a pound of
lard up to boiling point, and then drop into
it small pieces of the paste, and boil rapidly.
They should puff out and be a beautiful
golden brown. Roll each aigrette in grated
cheese when it has drained, and serve on a
paper doyley whilst hot. They are not good
cold.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="ph3">NEW RELATIONS.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox w200">
<img class="idropcap" src="images/i_476.jpg" width="200" height="274" alt='"H' /></div>

<p><span class="uppercase">ave</span> they come yet?”
asked a man’s voice,
which sounded through the house the
moment the door had been opened by
the latch-key in his hand.</p>

<p>A girl had darted out of a room upon
the ground-floor at the sound of the
opening door, and she gave quick reply.</p>

<p>“No, but we are expecting them
every minute. I’m glad you are back,
North. Father always likes to see you
first thing.”</p>

<p>The young man was divesting himself
of his overcoat in the hall. He was a
broad-shouldered muscular fellow, with
very much the same stamp of features
as his father, only that as he was clean-shaven,
all but a moustache, the square
outline of the jaw could be more distinctly
seen. It was not a handsome
face, but it was a strong one, and there
was a gleam of humour in the brown
eyes which redeemed it alike from
heaviness and sternness.</p>

<p>The sister was a merry-looking girl
of about twenty, with the family features,
a little square in outline, but she had
a tip-tilted nose, “a snub,” as the
brothers called it, which gave her an
expression of sauciness not at all contradicted
by the dancing light in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Come in and warm yourself. The
wind has been bitter all day. We must
wait tea for the travellers. Any news
in town?”</p>

<p>North walked into the long drawing-room,
which occupied all the space
through the house on one side of the
hall. The house, though it now stood in
a street, was detached from its neighbours,
and showed in many of its
arrangements that it had once been a
gentleman’s country abode. It was old-fashioned
and a little dark, but it wore
a homelike aspect; and the room, which
was panelled half-way up in sombre oak,
was filled with the dancing light from a
blazing fire of logs.</p>

<p>There were three persons in the room
when the brother and sister entered.
Mrs. Thomas Cossart (who was generally
known in the place as Mrs. Tom, on
account of the other Mrs. Cossart up at
the big house) was knitting in her arm-chair
with a book beside her. She was
a matronly lady, with a pleasant face,
which had been beautiful in youth, and
was still quite comely. Her elder
daughter Raby stood with a screen in
her hand shielding her face from the
blaze, and another son lounged upon the
sofa, his hands clasped behind his head.</p>

<p>It was sometimes said of the Cossarts
by their friends, that North and Ray
were the useful ones in the family, and
Raby and Cyril the ornamental. Raby
was tall and slight, and took after her
mother. Without being a beauty she
was a decidedly good-looking girl, and
had many admirers of both sexes. She
dressed always a little better and more
carefully than her sister; but she was
not really either useless or idle. She
had plenty of fun in her, and good
nature too. But she had a greater love
of admiration and amusement than that
possessed by Ray.</p>

<p>Cyril presented a contrast to all the
others of the family by being very fair
where they were all inclined to be dark.
As a child he had been singularly
beautiful, with big blue eyes and a
cloud of golden hair about his softly
tinted face. His mother had been
devoted to him from his babyhood, and
even his father had found it difficult
not to make something of an especial
darling of him.</p>

<p>Now at three and twenty he was a
very good-looking fellow, although some
declared that he was girlish and effeminate
in his looks. Certainly the golden
hair and big blue eyes were rather
suggestive of a fair girl; and this likeness
was perhaps a little intensified
from the fact that he was quite clean-shaven,
and did not grow even a
moustache, as Ray had often begged
him to do. But he had inherited
sufficient of the Cossart type of features
to redeem the face from the charge
of weakness. It was a refined and
etherialised face, but something of the
square outline of the jaw remained,
although the lips did not close over
each other in the firm way that was
noticeable in North and Ray, but were
a little inclined to fall apart, giving the
face a dreamy and abstracted expression,
which was much admired by many of
the young ladies of Isingford, who
were fond of making studies from Cyril
Cossart’s profile, and turning them into
pictures called “Sir Galahad,” or
“The Knight without fear and without
reproach.”</p>

<p>“Here they are!” cried Ray, who
was still lingering about the half open
door, “I hear wheels stopping. They
have come! Mother, I shall go and open
the door? It will look more friendly.”</p>

<p>She was across the hall before she had
finished speaking, and had thrown the
front door wide open before the maid
could arrive upon the scene. North
followed her and stood full in view. The
next minute their father led in a girl
dressed in deep mourning, whom he
pushed towards his daughter saying—</p>

<p>“There Sheila, there is Ray. She
will take care of you and make you
feel at home.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I will!” cried Ray,
kissing Sheila’s cold face. “Come
along in and see mother and Raby.
I’m so glad you have come all safe.
It feels just as though it would snow.
But it won’t matter if it does, now that
you’re safe home.”</p>

<p>Sheila, a little shy and bewildered in
her strange surroundings, was led into
the warm drawing-room, where she was
kissed by Mrs. Tom and Raby, and
installed beside the fire in a comfortable
chair, almost before she had time
to get out a word.</p>

<p>Mr. Tom had come in with North and
Oscar, and there was a considerable
confusion of tongues, kissing and welcoming.
For the moment Sheila was
left in her cosy corner; and it was then
that she heard a gentle voice at her
elbow saying—</p>

<p>“You must let me add my welcome
to the rest; though I am afraid it is
really a sorrowful time for you. We
are inclined to forget that what is our
gain is your loss.”</p>

<p>She looked up quickly, and saw that
a stranger was slipping into the seat
beside her. She did not guess for a
moment that he, too, was a cousin. He
looked so different from all the Cossarts
she had seen so far. Perhaps the
startled look in her big wistful eyes
showed this, for the voice continued
speaking.</p>

<p>“I am your cousin Cyril. Probably
you know our names from our father by
this time. I think I can feel for you
better than the rest—coming into this
strange life, which is so different from
anything you have known before. They
had been used to it all their lives—they
know nothing else. But I do, and I
can understand how you must feel
about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I feel anything yet,”
said Sheila slowly, “I have not had
time. But Uncle Tom has been very
kind. I think—I hope—I am sure I
ought to be very happy.”</p>

<p>Yet even as she spoke Sheila felt the
tears suddenly spring to her eyes. She
did not know how it was; but just this
arrival at a strange house, this feeling
of being suddenly cast into the midst
of a number of strange people seemed
to bring before her her loneliness in a
way she had never felt it before. She
looked round for Oscar, but Ray had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">{477}</a></span>
got him in her care, and was chattering
gaily to him. Her uncle was for the
moment engrossed with his wife and
elder son. The wave of loneliness
seemed to rise higher and higher about
her. She felt the sob in her throat, and
turned her face towards the fire to get
rid of the welling tears before they should
be seen.</p>

<p>“I know so well what you feel,” said
Cyril’s sympathetic voice in her ear.
“Often when I have come home from
college, or from other people’s houses,
the same feeling has come over me. If
I had been a girl I should have cried
too. It seemed like stepping into a
new world where one had no interests,
no heart, no sympathies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I don’t want to feel like
that!” said Sheila quickly. “That
would be wrong and ungrateful. Uncle
Tom has been so kind. You are all
kind. Only—only—I haven’t often been
away from home; and it seems all so
strange; and there isn’t any more home
left behind—that is what is the strangest
thing of all!”</p>

<p>Her voice broke for a moment, and
Cyril put out his hand and laid it on
hers in token of comprehension and
sympathy; but there was no time for
more words, for the group in the middle
of the room broke up.</p>

<p>There was a stir at the door, and two
maids appeared with the tea-table and
equipage; and Sheila found herself the
centre of attraction as the lamp shed
its light over the darkening room, and
everybody gathered round the fire to
discuss hot cakes and steaming cups of
tea, whilst they “took stock” of the
new cousins and tried to make them feel
at home.</p>

<p>Cyril spoke the least now; but Sheila
was conscious that he looked after her
wants with a gentle consideration, and
she felt grateful to him, and stole
glances at him from time to time,
wondering what made him so different
from all the rest. All were kind and
cousinly, and seemed interested in her,
and liked to hear her talk; but there
was a difference—a quiet sympathy
about Cyril’s manner which was totally
distinct from the friendliness of the rest.
He reminded her of the world in which
she had been accustomed to move.
Everything else was different, the very
atmosphere seemed changed, though
she could not have accounted for or
defined the change.</p>

<p>Ray took her upstairs at last.</p>

<p>“I am glad you are to stay a day or two
here. This is our spare room. Oscar
has the little one. We could not take
you in for good, or it would have left us
no spare room at all. Besides, they
want you up at Cossart Place. I wonder
how you and Effie will get on. This cold
spell has made her breathing bad; but
she is beginning to look forward to your
coming.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she like it at first?” asked
Sheila, reading something between the
lines.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, Effie is a bit
crossgrained. If she thinks of a thing
herself, she’s as keen after it as possible;
but if somebody else suggests it,
she takes a dislike to it directly. It’s
partly because she’s out of health, and
partly because she’s been so spoiled.
I get along with her very well, though
she’s not always in the sweetest of tempers.
But then perhaps none of us
are!” And Ray laughed, showing her
white even teeth.</p>

<p>Ray stayed and helped Sheila to
unpack the one box which had come
to River Street. Her heavy baggage
had been sent straight to Cossart Place.</p>

<p>“We don’t have a maid here; but
Effie has one. I daresay she’ll share
with you. You’ve been used to one, I
expect. You have been county people,
I know. We are only <i>bourgeoise</i>, of
course. I expect our ways will seem
funny to you!”</p>

<p>It did seem rather strange to Sheila
to come down and find the father and
elder son in morning dress. Cyril and
the girls dressed for dinner; but had
never got the rest of their men-folk to do
so. Indeed, it was but within the last
few years that they had been able to get
the father to consent to a seven o’clock
dinner. It had been the fashion in
Isingford for business men to leave their
works about five, and dine at six or
earlier, and have a supper later. The
girls had had something of a fight to
get afternoon tea and seven o’clock
dinner, and with that they had to be
content without further concessions to
more fashionable habits.</p>

<p>In the evening there was music, for
the Cossarts were fond of singing and
had good voices, though they had only
been trained by local teachers, and
lacked finish and culture. Cyril was
the exception. He had been a chorister
in his boyhood, and had been carefully
taught both at school and afterwards.
He generally declined to assist at the
family concert; but to-night he sang
several times, and got Sheila to sing
duets with him, though she told him she
had no voice, and was only good at
playing accompaniments.</p>

<p>It was true that her voice was not
powerful, but it was very sweet in tone,
and had been carefully cultivated by a
good master.</p>

<p>Cyril appreciated this, and Sheila
enjoyed his approval and friendliness;
and went to bed feeling more cheered
and less lonely than she would have
believed it possible.</p>

<p>The next day was a very interesting
and rather exciting one, for they were
both taken to the works by their uncle
and North, and Oscar was shown something
of what was expected of him in the
future. There was to be a good deal of
desk-work at first, which was not much
to his taste; but he was to receive
training in the electrical branch which
was being established in connection
with the works, so that when the new
buildings were opened, he would be
able to take a position there as assistant
manager. Meantime it was essential
that he should learn the routine of office
work and book-keeping; and he assented
to the drudgery willingly, his common
sense telling him that there was nothing
like beginning at the bottom of the
ladder. He had seen too much of the
evil effects of not understanding business
not to be ready and willing to acquire
the power himself of understanding it
thoroughly.</p>

<p>“North is a capital fellow,” he said
to Sheila that night, following her into
her room for a talk in private; for in
that busy, merry household there was
little time for confidential conversation,
and Sheila had been taken possession
of all the afternoon by her girl-cousins,
and introduced right and left to a
bewildering number of their friends.
“He isn’t one to make professions;
but I know he’ll do what he can to help
me. It will be dull work, some of it,
and I may be rather stupid at it; but I
mean to do my best, and get on if
I can.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will. I think they all
mean to be kind; but, Oscar, do you
call our cousins—well, what shall I
say? If we had met them at home,
do you think we should have called
them quite ladies and gentlemen—except
Cyril?”</p>

<p>Oscar laughed, and made a little expressive
grimace.</p>

<p>“Since they are our cousins, perhaps
we’d better not put the question quite so
straight, Sheila. But, indeed, it’s better
not to think too much about rank and
station and the gloss on the top. It’s
very nice when one can get it too; but
the great thing is whether people are
really good and honest and kindly, as
our relations are. And our mother was
one of them; we must not forget that.
It would be awfully snobbish of us to
look down on them—as though we were
better than they—after all they are doing
for us too!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—indeed, I don’t mean to
do that. Only things do seem funny
sometimes; and, you know, Cyril feels
it too. I think he feels it more than we
do. He is so very different from all the
rest.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Oscar slowly; “but
I’m not sure that I like him as well as
the others.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Oscar, I like him much the
best!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can see you do. Perhaps I
shall when I know him better. I feel
rather as though he gave himself airs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! It’s only that he feels
more as we do—he would like things
different. He has been to college, and
stayed with people who live differently.
I am quite glad he is here. He has
promised to come often to see me when
I go to The Grange. He likes to call it
The Grange, too. He thinks Cossart
Place sounds vulgar. Cyril and I think
alike in a lot of ways.”</p>

<p>“And when are you going to The
Grange? I thought Aunt Cossart was
to come and see you this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but Effie had one of her
attacks, and so she couldn’t. She will
write to-night and say if I am to go
to-morrow, or wait for another day. I
hope I shall get on with Effie; but, from
what Cyril says, I think she is very
<i>difficile</i>.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let Cyril set you against
people and things!” said Oscar, rather
gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I won’t!” was Sheila’s
eager answer.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">The Examiners report on the Second Twenty-four Questions.</span></p>




<p><span class="smcap">Practice</span> makes perfect, so though the first
instalment of answers in this competition was
good, the second proved better, and we look
forward to the third and last being the best
of all. It takes time to discover to what
fountains one ought to go for information;
but once that is done, the rest is comparatively
easy—you fill your pitcher and come away
triumphant.</p>

<p>The number who engaged in this second
trial was slightly under that of those taking
part in the first. Out of every hundred girls
who started with questions 1-24, about fifteen
failed to put in an appearance. Many causes,
from whimsicality to illness, no doubt account
for this. It was often, we are sure, unavoidable,
for some girls whom we missed had done
so well that they would have had a good place
had they only continued.</p>

<p>We give here our notes on questions 25-48
inclusive, so that competitors may check their
own answers and see in some cases what they
might have replied had they been fortunate
enough to find out. General remarks on the
competition, as we said last month, will
follow when we come to intimate who the
painstaking girls are who have won prizes
and certificates.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>25. Who was the monarch who
once attended the rehearsal of his
own funeral?</b></p>

<p>The monarch we had in view in framing
this question was Charles V., Emperor of
Germany and King of Spain. After his abdication
in 1555-56 he retired to the monastery
of St. Juste in the north of Estremadura, and
here he resolved to celebrate his own obsequies.
His domestics marched to the chapel of the
monastery in funeral procession with black
tapers in their hands, and he himself followed
in his shroud. He was laid in his coffin with
much solemnity. “The service for the dead
was chanted, and Charles joined in the prayers
which were offered up for the repose of his
soul, mingling his tears with those which his
attendants shed, as if they had been celebrating
a real funeral.” Judging by the numbers who
failed to answer, this was one of our difficult
questions.</p>

<p><b>26. What is the largest palace in
the world used as a residence?</b></p>

<p>Three palaces were prominent in the answers
given—the Vatican at Rome, the Winter
Palace at St. Petersburg, and the Palace of
Versailles in the neighbourhood of Paris. The
last-named, however, was mentioned by error,
as it is now not a residence, but little more
than a showplace. But it is huge enough, for
in the heyday of its prosperity it accommodated
about ten thousand persons—courtiers, dependents,
etc. To the Vatican, the residence of
the Pope, apparently belongs the credit of
being of all palaces that on the largest scale.
It is said to contain no fewer than seven
thousand rooms. It became the fixed residence
of the Popes in 1377. The Winter Palace at
St. Petersburg is also an enormous structure,
in which six thousand persons have frequently
had a habitation.</p>

<p><b>27. What is the exercise most conducive
to physical beauty?</b></p>

<p>The answers to this query were as varied as
could be. Dancing, fencing, cycling, swimming,
golfing, dumb-bell drill, and many
other forms of exercise all had their advocates.
Some girls said, “Housekeeping for ever!”
and recommended constant devotion to sweeping
and dusting; but others remarked that
that was too narrow a view, and that we
ought to move about in the open air as well.
Most, however, held that the right form of
exercise was walking, the cheapest, safest, and
best of all. “And see,” says one competitor,
“that you persevere in it and do it in all
weathers, but the very worst, and particularly
in winter.”</p>

<p><b>28. What was the first street ever
lit by gas?</b></p>

<p>This was Pall Mall in London, which was
first lit by gas on the 28th of January, 1807.
The introduction of gas-lighting into London
is due to the zeal and unwearied patience of a
German named Winsor. He managed to
gain some supporters, “and,” says a writer
in Chambers’s <i>Book of Days</i>, “the long line
between St. James’s Palace and Cockspur
Street blazed out in a burst of gas-lamps on
the night in question to the no small admiration
of the public.” Westminster Bridge was lit
with gas for the first time on the last night of
1812. Two years later in other parts of the
metropolis gas was introduced on the streets,
and from that time the new mode of lighting
gradually made its way all over the world.</p>

<p><b>29. How fast can one read when
reading silently?</b></p>

<p>Most competitors gave an answer to this
question; but why did not all? It was easy
enough, because the best answer a girl could
make was to record the result of experimenting
on herself. It was pointed out by many with
much truth that the rate of reading varies
greatly with different individuals and also
with the kind of book read. We cannot, for
instance, read philosophy as rapidly as history,
or history as fast as a work of fiction. Poetry
also, says a sensible competitor, must be read
slowly in order to appreciate the style and
rhythm. A moderately rapid reader, says
this same competitor, will read history at the
rate of about 600 words in five minutes, fiction
at about 2,000 words in the same time, and
poetry at about 700 words. The 600 and
700 words here given appear slow compared
with the 2,000; but there is all the difference
in the world between reading to remember
and criticise and reading merely for a pastime.</p>

<p><b>30. What famous philanthropist
was known as the “Nightingale of
the House of Commons?”</b></p>

<p>When a girl shoots a bow at a venture she
may hit the mark, but more often she does
not. Here are some of the random shots at
this answer—the Earl of Shaftesbury, John
Bright, Mr. Gladstone, Sir Henry Fawcett,
Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, Lord Coleridge,
the Earl of Chatham, and William Pitt. No,
it was none of these—it was William Wilberforce,
who will always be associated with the
abolition of the slave trade. His remarkably
sweet voice, so often used on behalf of those
unable to plead for themselves, obtained for
him the name to which we have referred in our
question.</p>

<p><b>31. How many hours a day should
we give to sleep?</b></p>

<p>There was a good deal of common-sense
shown here in the answers, it being generally
allowed that no hard and fast rule could be
laid down. “Sleep till you have slept
enough,” says one girl; “and enough is
not the same with everybody.” The time
will be found to vary, with grown-up people,
from six to eight hours in the twenty-four,
it very much depending on whether they
are strong or weakly. One competitor quotes
a medical authority to the effect that “the
weakly very rarely require more than nine
hours’ sleep at the utmost, and a longer
indulgence will scarcely ever fail to injure
them.”</p>

<p><b>32. What is the most famous signal
ever made to the British Navy?</b></p>

<p>Hardly any competitors omitted to answer
this question; almost every one right too.
The ever-to-be-remembered signal was that
made by Lord Nelson, before the battle of
Trafalgar—“England expects every man to do
his duty.” It was a signal, says Southey, in
his <i>Life of Nelson</i>, received throughout the
fleet with a shout of answering acclamation,
“made sublime by the spirit which it breathed
and the feeling which it expressed.” As everyone
knows, it was the last signal of our great
naval hero, for he received his mortal wound
in the heat of the action.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that one girl, whom
we guess to be a humorist, would have it
that the most famous naval signal was that
made to the British fleet at the conclusion of
the greatest naval review ever seen—that held
in commemoration of the Queen’s Diamond
Jubilee, in 1897. The Commander-in-Chief
signalled that, at the request of the Prince of
Wales, he “ordered the mainbrace to be
spliced,” which, says our competitor, refers to
“an extra ration of grog!”</p>

<p><b>33. What useful discovery was
made by lighting a fire on the sand
and using pieces of natron (sub-carbonate
of soda) to support the cooking-pot?</b></p>

<p>The story of the discovery of glass—whether
an actual historical fact or only a legend we
shall not too particularly inquire—proved to
be well known to all our girls. To quote one
of them: “The credit of inventing glass was
always given by the ancients to the Phœnicians.
It was a discovery made quite accidentally by
some Phœnician merchants, who were homeward
bound in a ship laden with natron or
soda. A storm came on, which obliged them
to land on a sandy tract under Mount Carmel.
There they rested their cooking pots on blocks
of natron, and when the cooking was over
found glass produced, by the union under heat
of the alkali and the sand of the shore.”</p>

<p><b>34. What are the “borrowed days,”
and how do they come by their name?</b></p>

<p>Those who did not answer this question, and
those who answered it wrongly, are now
informed that the “Borrowed Days” referred
to, are the last three days of March. According
to a popular tradition they were borrowed
by March from April, in order to accomplish
the destruction of a parcel of unoffending
young sheep, a purpose, however, in which
March did not succeed. The story is told in
a well-known Scottish rhyme:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“March said to Aperill,</div>
<div class="verse">I see three sheep upon yon hill,</div>
<div class="verse">And if you lend me days three</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll find a way to make them dee.</div>
<div class="verse">The first o’ them was wind and weet.</div>
<div class="verse">The second o’ them was snaw and sleet.</div>
<div class="verse">The third o’ them was sic a freeze,</div>
<div class="verse">It froze the birds’ beaks to the trees.</div>
<div class="verse">And when the three days were past and gane,</div>
<div class="verse">The three poor sheep came hirpling (<i>limping</i>) hame.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some girls got the “borrowed days” mixed
up with the extra day that comes in Leap
year. One told us that they were “the mild
days of winter borrowed from Spring.”
Another gave them as “Sunday, Monday and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">{479}</a></span>
Saturday.” Three or four furnished an
interesting piece of local information to the
effect that in Cheshire the name “Borrowed
Days,” is given to the first eleven days of May.</p>

<p><b>35. What is the simplest and least
troublesome of all cookery processes?</b></p>

<p>Some girls surprised us by apparently
knowing little about this woman’s subject; a
few surprised us still more by not answering at
all. There was room for difference of opinion.
Boiling, steaming, grilling, toasting, roasting,
and baking all met with support, but on the
whole we side with the girls who said stewing.
It is a method that certainly requires very little
attention, barring the care that must of course
be taken to keep the stew from sticking to the
bottom of the pot and burning, if the
stewing be done in a saucepan or in a jar.
Some competitors fell into error by giving
such answers as “boiling an egg,” “making a
milk pudding,” “boiling a potato in its
jacket,” and “preparing a Devonshire junket.”
They should have taken note that the query
spoke of <i>processes</i> not of <i>performances</i>.</p>

<p><b>36. Are there any extinct volcanoes
in Great Britain?</b></p>

<p>“Not one,” says a confident competitor.
In opposition to this, however, we have the
answers of a great many who knew better, and
were well aware that “the volcanoes of Britain
are still around and beneath us, on the sea-coast
and in the heart of the country, under
our great cities and in our most favourite
holiday haunts.” Some gave examples from
central England, and one girl quoting from an
article that appeared not long ago in the
<i>Leisure Hour</i>, pointed out that “what is now
the heart of England, was once dotted with
volcanic vents.” Others took their illustrations
from Devonshire, from North Wales, from the
neighbourhood of Edinburgh and from the
Western Isles of Scotland.</p>

<p><b>37. What famous musical composition
came to a violinist in a dream?</b></p>

<p>The competitors who did not answer this
question were a numerous company. Some
made such guesses at it as Haydn’s “Creation,”
and the “Moonlight Sonata.” But—without
going into the dream question—Haydn was
not a violinist, and neither was Beethoven.
The musician of our query was the famous
violin player, Giuseppe Tartini, and the composition
was his singularly fine piece, “Il
Trillo del Diavolo.” One night the Evil One
appeared to Tartini in a dream. “The idea
struck me,” says the composer, “to hand him
my fiddle, and to see what he could do with
it. But how great was my astonishment when
I heard him play with consummate skill a
sonata of such exquisite beauty as surpassed
the boldest flight of my imagination.” When
Tartini awoke he seized his violin and tried to
reproduce the sounds he had heard. “But,”
he sorrowfully says, “it was in vain. The
piece I then composed, the Devil’s Sonata,
although the best I ever wrote, was far below
the one I had heard in my dream!”</p>

<p><b>38. When did witchcraft cease to be
recognised as a crime by the law of
England?</b></p>

<p>This query was generally well answered,
and there was really no difficulty about it.
The last trial for witchcraft in England was
that of Jane Wenham, who was convicted at
Hertford in 1712. Feeling towards witchcraft
had, by that time, begun to change,
however, and she was not executed. Twenty-four
years later—that is to say, in 1736—came
the repeal of the famous statute against
witchcraft passed at the accession of James I.
At the same time was repealed the Act of
the Scottish Parliament passed in 1563 making
it a capital offence to use witchcraft, sorcery,
or necromancy, or to pretend to such knowledge,
or to seek help from witches.</p>

<p><b>39. What famous book was mislaid
when in manuscript and partly written,
and was only discovered by the
author nine years afterwards in the
drawer of an old writing-desk?</b></p>

<p>Puzzled? Yes, many were puzzled and
answered nothing. A few bold spirits ventured
on such guesses as <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>,
<i>Evelyn’s Diary</i>, <i>Peter Simple</i>, and <i>Jessica’s
First Prayer</i>! The book in question was the
Waverley of Sir Walter Scott. About a
third of the first volume of this work was
written about the year 1805, and then thrown
aside in the drawer of an old writing-desk and
entirely forgotten. Nine years afterwards,
the author himself says, “I happened to want
some fishing tackle for the use of a guest,
when it occurred to me to search the old
writing-desk already mentioned, in which I
used to keep articles of that nature. I got
access to it with some difficulty, and in looking
for lines and flies, the long-lost manuscript
presented itself. I immediately set to work
to complete it.”</p>

<p><b>40. What English cathedral was
set on fire and severely damaged by a
man who was afterwards found to be
insane?</b></p>

<p>The fire was that caused in York Minster
on the 2nd of February, 1829, by Jonathan
Martin, who, as the question says, was subsequently
discovered to be out of his mind.
Having taken it into his head that it was his
duty to destroy the cathedral, he concealed
himself after evening service on the 1st of
February behind a monument in the north
transept, and in the night collected inflammable
material which he set fire to. The
whole of the beautiful tabernacle work of
carved oak, the stalls, the pulpit, the organ,
the roof, and much of the stonework of the
choir, were all destroyed, the east window
which was in great danger, being saved with
difficulty. The building was restored at a
cost of about £65,000, which was raised by
a national subscription. This question was
well answered. A few girls gave instances
of fires at the cathedrals of Carlisle and
Salisbury, but the insane incendiary was left
out of account. Four or five gave the burning
of St. Paul’s in the Great Fire of 1666, as that
well-known event is described in Mr. W.
Harrison Ainsworth’s <i>Old St. Paul’s</i>, but they
should have remembered that a novelist’s
facts should be verified before quoting them
as history.</p>

<p><b>41. What is the best diet for brain-workers?</b></p>

<p>There is no doubt that brain-workers—whether
literary, professional or business people—need
the best of food served in the most
agreeable manner, and in variety and abundance.
If it were possible to live by brain
alone, without any exercise of the muscles,
then the diet might be exclusively confined to
those articles which contain the fat, salt and
phosphorus of which the brain is composed.
But this being out of the question, a wide
variety of food is necessary for the brain-working
classes, its quantity and quality
being adapted to nourish the whole body with
special reference to the nervous system. An
important point is that the food be light and
easily digested. Most girls answered this
question, and many sensible replies were
received.</p>

<p><b>42. What saint was so able a musician
that, according to tradition, an
angel descended to earth enraptured
with her melodious strains?</b></p>

<p>Few queries were better or more fully
answered than this one, the essence of
most of the replies being that the saint was
St. Cecilia, a young Roman lady of noble
birth, who suffered martyrdom about 329—perhaps
earlier. She “has long been regarded
as the tutelary saint of music and musicians,
but the period at which she was first so looked
upon is involved in obscurity.” When the
tradition mentioned in the question originated
is equally unknown. It is an odd fact that
early writers make no mention of her skill in
music.</p>

<p><b>43. What is the origin of the three
ostrich feathers as a badge of the
Prince of Wales?</b></p>

<p>This has long been a matter of perplexity
to antiquaries. The cherished and popular
belief, however—quoted by almost all our
competitors—is that the feathers were derived
from the blind King of Bohemia, who lost
his life at the battle of Crecy in 1346. The
feathers do not appear in connection with
our Princes of Wales till after that battle.
The ostrich feather, it appears, was a distinction
of Luxemburg, and John, Count of
Luxemburg, was the original style and title of
the King of Bohemia, who fell so bravely at
Crecy. The first Prince of Wales to assume
the feathers was of course Edward the Black
Prince, the victor of Crecy.</p>

<p><b>44. When did ignorant people in
this country imagine that they had
been defrauded out of eleven days by
those in authority?</b></p>

<p>It was in 1752 when the Act for the change
of Style came into operation in this country.
After the 2nd of September of that year, the
following day was held to be not the 3rd, but
the 14th, thus dropping out eleven days.
The common people of England, we are told,
“were violently inflamed against the statesmen
who had carried through the bill for the
change of style, and generally believed that
they had been defrauded out of eleven days
(as if eleven days of their destined lives) by
the transaction. Accordingly for some time
afterwards a favourite opprobrious cry to
unpopular statesmen in the streets and on the
hustings was, ‘Who stole the eleven days?
Give us back the eleven days!’” A few girls
failed to answer this question, but not so many
as we expected.</p>

<p><b>45. Who was the hermit who lived
for over thirty years on the top of
a pillar?</b></p>

<p>This was the famous St. Simeon Stylites,
so called from the Greek word <i>stylos</i>, a pillar.
He lived early in the fifth century and adopted
his original mode of life by way of penance,
beginning with residence on the top of a pillar
nine feet high. This was raised by degrees
to the somewhat incredible height of sixty
feet. He lived on his pillar situated on a
mountain-side thirty or forty miles from
Antioch for over thirty years, and died on the
top in the year 459. He was the founder of
the singular race of pillar-saints who, though
never very numerous, existed in Eastern lands
down to the twelfth century.</p>

<p><b>46. What famous stone in this
country is said to have been Jacob’s
pillow?</b></p>

<p>Competitors were right in saying that this
is the Coronation Stone now in Westminster
Abbey, brought from Scotland by Edward I.
on his return from invading that country in
1296. According to some, it was originally
the stone on which Jacob rested his head
when he slept at Bethel and had a vision of
angels ascending and descending the ladder
between heaven and earth. Old chroniclers
give a pretty circumstantial account of its
wanderings till it arrived at Scone, the
coronation city of the ancient kings of
Scotland, from which King Edward carried
it away. We notice that two or three girls
describe the stone as of marble—“black
marble,” says one. They are wrong. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">{480}</a></span>
block of sandstone—to be particular, “a dull
reddish or purplish sandstone, with a few
small embedded pebbles.”</p>

<p><b>47. Why is the wedding-ring worn
on the fourth finger of the left hand?</b></p>

<p>Nearly everybody gave an answer and a
good answer. We shall quote one competitor
in full, and she will reply for all the rest:
The selection of the fourth finger of the left
hand as the wedding-ring finger both in
Pagan and Christian times is accounted for
by several reasons. In an ancient ritual of
marriage, the husband placed the ring on
the top of the thumb of the left hand
whilst he said, “In the name of the Father”;
he then removed it to the forefinger, saying,
“And of the Son,” and then to the middle
finger with the words, “And of the Holy
Ghost,” and with the final word “Amen” he
placed the ring on the fourth finger, where it
remained.</p>

<p>The ancient supposition that a vein led
direct from the fourth finger to the heart, and
the fact that this finger is used less than any
other, the ring being thereby less liable to
receive injury, were doubtless also at the root
of this old custom.</p>

<p><b>48. How did the forget-me-not get
its name?</b></p>

<p>Several popular traditions, all no doubt
equally authentic, were quoted in reply,
hardly any competitor omitting to answer.
According to some, the name perpetuates the
last words of a lover to his mistress as he threw
her the flower she craved of him at the cost of
his own life in the Danube.</p>

<p>Another tradition told, with variations, by
a good many was that “Adam, as he named
the plants in Paradise, bade them all remember
their names. One little flower, that had allowed
its thoughts to wander, had to ask the father
of men to repeat what he had said. ‘By
what name dost thou call me?’ ‘Forget-me-not,’
was the reply; which has caused that
humble flower ever since to droop its head in
shame and ignominy.”</p>

<h2><a name="ANSWERS_TO_CORRESPONDENTS" id="ANSWERS_TO_CORRESPONDENTS">ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</a></h2>


<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span>—The two questions you ask us are in themselves
of little importance, but the condition of
your mind which lies behind them compels a
little advice. Your first question, “What is a good
way of getting out of being afraid that there is
some illness or disease the matter with oneself?” is
easily answered. There is no disease without definite
symptoms. You will never get a disease which
will leave you very long in doubt about your health.
If you want to make perfectly certain, get yourself
examined by a physician and have done with your
ideas. Your second question is due to the same
thing as the first—a morbid self-consciousness.
Anybody can think herself into any trouble. You
start by fearing that you may get—let us say
phthisis. In a few months you begin to think that
you may have phthisis. A little time afterwards
you come to the conclusion that you are going to
get phthisis, the next stage is a conviction that you
have phthisis, and the last stage is a feeling of
certainty that you have the disease, a certainty
which is unshaken by the assurance that your chest
is normal, and that the supposed phthisis does not
interfere with your health. The first two stages
of this history are states of morbid self-consciousness,
the next two are on the verge of sanity, the
last is a definite disease—not phthisis, but melancholia!
You must get yourself to think about
other things than your own imaginary evils; a
little mental struggle, and it will all come easily.
Read the article we published on blushing and
nervousness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vanity.</span>—Weak ankles are very commonly due to
wearing high-heeled shoes. Boots which button
up the legs are not so liable as shoes to weaken the
ankles, because they protect the latter, but with
high-heeled shoes the ankle is left bare, and consequently
every time that you twist your foot, you
wrench the ankle-joint. We have seen serious
disease of the ankle following repeated wrenching
or spraining from wearing high-heeled shoes. The
higher and narrower the heels are, the more liable
are they to do harm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hereward the Wake.</span>—Yes! tobacco-chewing is
exceedingly injurious. Tobacco contains a large
quantity of nicotine, a highly poisonous substance.
When tobacco is chewed, this nicotine is taken
into the stomach and absorbed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackwater.</span>—We have never heard of a disease or
symptom called “blackwater.” We expect that
what you mean is “waterbrash”; at all events your
description will fit this symptom. Waterbrash is a
fairly common symptom of indigestion, especially
of those varieties due to excesses of starchy food,
and those connected with nervous complaints.
Read the answer to “Muriel” (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54735">Jan. 21, 1899</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peggy.</span>—The combination of obesity with thin brittle
nails is very common. It seems that the condition
of the nails may be directly due to corpulency.
The only treatment we can suggest is to relieve the
obesity. Conceivably massage of the fingers might
be of service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy Dimples.</span>—We have answered this question
before. We do not think that anæmia is on
the increase. Anæmia of girls, that is, chlorosis or
green sickness, is from the beginning a chronic
disease. The question whether chlorosis is likely
to lead to consumption is very important. It certainly
is not <i>likely</i> to do so, and our experience
leads us to think that anæmic subjects are not
appreciably more liable to phthisis than are healthy
persons. Theoretically, we should have expected
otherwise. Of course some form of anæmia is invariable
in the later stages of consumption, as it is
in every other wasting disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erda.</span>—Pneumonia is not an hereditary disease, and
the children of a woman who has had pneumonia,
are no more liable to get that disease than are
ordinary persons. Pneumonia is an infectious
disease, and is very liable to recur.</p></div>


<h3>STUDY AND STUDIO.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Victoria.</span>—The first number of the <span class="smcap">Girl’s Own
Paper</span> was issued on January 3rd, 1880; of the <i>Boy’s
Own Paper</i> a year earlier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In April.</span>—Without hearing your violin we cannot
say whether its tone is good enough for you to play
upon it at the examination. If it is “a very nice
old” violin, we doubt your being able to procure a
better one for £8, but your teacher must really be
the judge. The quality of the violin, so long as
you have a decent instrument, should not affect
your chances of passing. Of more importance is
your inability to play from memory. You should
practise this art. Doubtless your teacher has a
clear synopsis of what you will be expected to do at
the examination.</p>

<p>A. V. D. G.—1. Hand gymnastics would not improve
your case. All you need is diligent practice, and
again practice, guided by strict attention. Do not
allow yourself to alight on wrong notes in the
manner you describe; always practise slowly at
first, increasing the pace until perfect. Do not
attempt music that is too difficult for you. We
suppose you are taking lessons, as you are only
fifteen, and you should be guided by your teacher.
2. “Op.” is the abbreviation for “opus,” the Latin
word for “work.” The works of musicians are
numbered in a certain order, and the piece you
mention must belong to Schumann’s 21st work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eglaia.</span>—1. The sign - placed over a note means that
the note is to be emphasised.—2. Your writing is
disfigured by enormous loops and flourishes, which
help to make it illegible. For instance, we fear
we have not deciphered your pseudonym correctly.
Without these excrescences, your writing would be
good. Two answers are our limit: <i>vide</i> rules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Earnest Student.</span>—The cheapest musical <i>conservatoires</i>
are on the Continent, and it is easy to obtain
a first-class musical education for a low fee at such
places at Leipsic, Dresden, Bonn, or Berlin, but
then the cost of board and lodging has to be added.
At Leipsic you would have to pay from about £67
to £90 for board, lodging, and musical instruction,
and you can obtain all particulars by addressing a
letter to “An das Directorium des Conservatoriums”
in one of the towns we have mentioned.
In London we think the Guildhall School of Music
is the least expensive, as the number of subjects
may be limited. In the Royal College the fee is
£40 a year for tuition; in the Royal Academy,
£11 11s. per term, with an entrance fee of £5 5s.
In the “Guildhall,” lessons on separate subjects
may be obtained from £1 11s. 6d. per term. We
advise you (if you can come to London) to write to
these three institutions for lists of fees, scholarships,
etc., also to Trinity College, Mandeville
Place, Manchester Square, W. We might help
you more if we knew where you live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Kentish Maid.</span>—Why not enter one of the
Training Colleges? You have first of all to
pass the “Queen’s Scholarship” examination;
apply for particulars, Education Department,
London, or A. Bourne Esq., British and Foreign
School Society, Temple Chambers, London, E.C.
After passing this examination, you receive two
years’ excellent training at a nominal fee for board
and education, the amount of which fee depends on
the college. At Stockwell (a splendid college), it is
£25 for two (in special cases three) years’ board and
education; at others we believe it is less, but these
particulars can be obtained from the individual
college. You might also with advantage consult
Mrs. Watson’s articles on “What are the County
Councils doing for Girls?” in the <span class="smcap">Girl’s Own
Paper</span> for 1897.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amateur Society.</span>—Miss M. Hedge requests us to
again bring before our readers her society for studying
foreign languages by means of correspondence.
A copy of the rules, price twopence, may be
obtained on application to her at 19, East Hill,
Colchester.</p></div>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Gertrude P.</span> (Tewkesbury).—We should advise you
to get a book on heraldry through some reliable
second-hand bookseller. They are not very cheap
when large, and that would be the best way of
getting a good one. Boutell’s <i>English Heraldry</i>,
or his <i>Heraldry Historical and Popular</i>, would suit
you, and they are not expensive even when new.
They are the smallest books on the subject.
Reeves and Turner, 196, Strand, W., publish the
first of them. There are several translations of
Dante: Cary, and Longfellow’s of the “Divina
Commedia.” The “Inferno” was translated
separately by Ellaby in 1871. You would get these
easily second-hand, we think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Regular Reader</span>, <span class="smcap">Geisha</span>, and Others.—We are
always very sorry for people who get stains of any
kind on coloured gowns, for they are so difficult to
deal with, and the cures for stains are so disappointing
in their effects. In the first place, the
utmost delicacy is required in manipulating, or the
stain will spread and be made worse; and we are
always inclined to think that the people who
manage to make them are not those who are likely
to take them out well. They would probably be
careless and “slap-dash.” Copying and marking
inks are removed with a strong solution of bleaching
powder (borax or soda), after which apply a cold
solution of oxalic acid; then rinse in cold water; or
instead of the bleaching powder, you might use
lemon juice. But we fear “R. R.’s” red dress would
not stand it, and you do not mention of what material
it is. Geisha’s wine or jelly stain may perhaps
be removed by holding the stained part over a basin,
and rubbing some common salt into it; and then
by pouring through it from the spout of a kettle
some boiling water till the stain disappears. Fruit
stains, if old, have become almost dyes, and if
washed when quite fresh with pure water, would
generally come out. In the days of sulphur
matches, the vapour from two or three was enough
to remove any fruit stain. Salts of lemon would,
we fear, take the colour out entirely. Failing the
matches, however, you may burn a little sulphur on
a small tin cover, and then making a small paper
funnel, hold the <i>large</i> end over the sulphur and the
small one under the spot. This treatment should
take out fruit stains from any fabric.</p>

<p>E. M. P.—Soap-jelly is made as follows:—Take 10
quarts of rain water, 3½ lb. of good yellow soap,
1 lb. of washing soda. Slice up the soap and put
on to boil with the water, keep on stirring, and
when the soap is dissolved add the soda. Stir
carefully, as it easily boils over, and when all is
dissolved, pour into a barrel to keep. It will form
a jelly when cold, and keeps a long time. Of
course, if you find these proportions too excessive,
you can make half the quantity.</p>

<p>E. M.—Although perhaps incorrect, it is usual in conversation
to drop the “h” in names ending in
“ham,” but with certain exceptions, such, for
example, as “Etchingham” in Sussex. It is not a
“cockneyism” to do so. A certain amount of
abbreviation and clipping of words is permissible in
colloquial and rapid speaking. We say “won’t,”
but write at full length “will not,” and we say
“don’t,” but write “do not.” Such clipping of
words in writing is bad style. People also write
“its” for “it is,” which is likewise objectionable;
and if they wish to abbreviate, they should, in this
case, write thus, “it’s.” We should simply say
“both dogs”; the other words are superfluous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Reader.</span>—If the brothers and sisters of your friend
are much older than yourself, there is nothing remarkable
in their calling you by your Christian
name; but it would depend on the degree of intimacy
whether you should call them by theirs; and as by
your writing you seem to be quite a child, we
should say no, unless you were asked to do so.
Many young men are rather tenacious on the
subject, and resent it from little girls.</p></div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
